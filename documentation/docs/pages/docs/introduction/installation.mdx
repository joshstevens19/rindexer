# Installation

rindexer installation process is simple and can be done with a few steps.

:::info
rindexer uses docker to spin up postgres databases for you when it runs locally so its recommended to install [docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
if you don't have it installed already.

## rindexer CLI

rindexer operates as a CLI toolset to make it easy to create new rindexer projects or run existing ones.

### Installing

:::warning
If you’re on Windows, you will need to install and use Git BASH or WSL, as your terminal,
since rindexer installation does not support Powershell or Cmd.
:::

```bash
curl -L https://rindexer.xyz/install.sh | bash
```

Once installed you can run the following command to check the installation was successful:

```bash
rindexer --help
```

```bash
Blazing fast EVM indexing tool built in rust

Usage: rindexer [COMMAND]

Commands:
  new           Creates a new rindexer no-code project or rust project
  start         Start various services like indexers, GraphQL APIs or both together
  add           Add elements such as contracts to the rindexer.yaml file
  codegen       Generates rust code based on rindexer.yaml or graphql queries
  delete        Delete data from the postgres database or csv files
  phantom       Use phantom events to add your own events to contracts
  help          Print this message or the help of the given subcommand(s)

Options:
  -h, --help     Print help
  -V, --version  Print version
```

you can also get help on any of the commands for example to get help on the new command you can run:

```bash
rindexer new --help
```

To upgrade to the latest version of rindexer you can run the following command:

```bash
rindexerup
```

To uninstall rindexer you can run the following command:

```bash
rindexerdown
```

## Docker pre-built image

There's a pre-built docker image which can be used to run `rindexer` inside your dockerized infra:

[`ghcr.io/joshstevens19/rindexer`](https://github.com/users/joshstevens19/packages/container/package/rindexer)

### Create new project
To create a new `no-code` project in your current directory, you can run the following:

`docker run -it -v $PWD:/app/project_path ghcr.io/joshstevens19/rindexer new -p /app/project_path no-code`

### Use with existing project
To use it with an existing project and a running postgres instance you can simply invoke:

```
export PROJECT_PATH=/path/to/your/project
export DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:pass@postgres/db"

docker-compose up -d
```

This will start all local indexing and if you have enabled the graphql endpoint, it will become exposed under:

http://localhost:3001


**If you are using csv you do not need to install docker, it is only recommended with postgres or if you're deploying rindexer in cloud environments.**

## Rust - optional

If you are only doing no-code projects you do not need rust installed but if you are doing rust projects you will need to install rust.
You can install rust by following the instructions [here](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

That is it lets now walk through how you can start using rindexer.
