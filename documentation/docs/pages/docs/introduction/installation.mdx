## Docker

rindexer uses docker to spin up postgres databases for you when it runs locally so its recommended to install [docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
if you don't have it installed already.

**If you are using csv you do not need to install docker, it is only recommended with postgres.**

## Rust - optional

If you are only doing no-code projects you do not need rust installed but if you are doing rust projects you will need to install rust.
You can install rust by following the instructions [here](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

That is it lets now walk through how you can start using rindexer.
