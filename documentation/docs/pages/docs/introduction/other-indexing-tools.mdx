# Other indexing tools

rindexer is not a tool to take market share from other indexing tools, it is a tool to provide more options for developers
to index data on EVM chains. rindexer allows you to index data with no learning curve and no-code if you pick that option. 
The current indexing tools are mainly JavaScript based alongside require code to be written to use them, 
rindexer is a Rust based indexing tool and has no-code features built into it. 
Diversity is very important in the industry and rindexer is here to provide more options for developers to index data on EVM chains.
rindexer is not a company or a business it is an open-source project and is here to help the industry move forward.

## TheGraph - Pay per query

rindexer is not trying to replace `TheGraph` or even sees itself as a competitor to `TheGraph`.
`TheGraph` vision is inspirational and the future of data should be decentralised provable indexing 
and we are not trying to replace that or take away from all the amazing things `TheGraph` has done for our industry. 
`TheGraph` have now sunset the hosting service being true to their ethos of decentralisation which you have to
respect.

rindexer was created to make indexing easier and faster. In the future I see a world where 
rindexer and `TheGraph` can work together to provide the best indexing experience for developers, you should be able
to resync decentralised verified data from `TheGraph` from rindexer using no-code. 

If you want decentralised provable indexing `TheGraph` is the tool you should be using not rindexer.

## Shadow - Paid

:::note
rindexer has first-party support for phantom events powered by Shadow, you can read more about it [here](/docs/start-building/phantom).
:::

`Shadow` allows you to add custom events and view functions to smart contracts and is a very powerful indexing service.
The `Shadow` team are doing great work and I have a lot of respect for them and the work they are doing.

## dyRPC - Paid

:::note
rindexer has first-party support for phantom events powered by dyRPC, you can read more about it [here](/docs/start-building/phantom).
:::

`dyRPC` is a tool built on top of overlay which can be ran on any erigon node and allows you to also modify the contract's source code
adding gasless custom events and view functions. The `dyRPC` team are awesome.

## Cryo - Free

`Cryo` is a great way to extract data from all EVM chains and is awesome for data analysis and research. It also is powered
by a CLI tool allowing you to get this data using the CLI tool only. Really great tool with an incredible team behind it.

## TrueBlocks - Free

TrueBlocks.io is a blockchain data indexing and querying tool designed to provide highly detailed and decentralized
access to Ethereum blockchain data. It aims to enable users to efficiently extract and interact with blockchain data for various applications such as analytics, auditing, and reporting.
Awesome team and amazing tool.

## Ponder - Free

`Ponder` is a great indexing tool which is very feature rich and has a lot of great features. I really respect
the work that has gone into `Ponder` and I think it is a great tool for indexing data on EVM chains. rindexer 
took some inspiration from the `Ponder` codebase and only have love for the `Ponder` team.
It is built in JavaScript and you can build your own custom indexers with it.

## Goldsky - Paid

`Goldsky` is a great indexing tool which has no-code elements, they also offer bespoke services to build custom indexing solutions.
Great team and great product.

## Subsquid - Free features and Paid features

`Subsquid` is a great indexing tool which supports EVM based indexing as well as non-EVM based indexing. It is built
around the subsquid network which is a decentralised query engine. They have a great team and a great product.
Accessing all the historical data is free with subsquid but if you want the SQD cloud hosting then it costs.

## GhostGraph - Free features and Paid features

`GhostGraph` is a first-of-a-kind indexing solution that lets you write your index transformations in solidity. `GhostGraph` makes building fast indexers (subgraphs) for smart contracts easy. It is currently in beta.

## Envio - Free features and Paid features
`Envio` (now referred to as HyperIndex) is a multi-chain indexer focused on performance and flexibility. It connects to an RPC node or HyperSync, an optimized Rust-built data node that massively improves indexing speeds.
