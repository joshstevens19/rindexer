# RPC node providers

RPC providers speed has a direct link to how fast you can index data, providers who try to return data as fast as possible are the best providers to have.
With RPC providers the fastest providers are ones which return you the to and from block ranges even if you supply an out of range block request.
This means you can extract that data from the error message and use it to get the the biggest depth of logs out of a single request.
The slower providers give you a max block range and this means you have to crawl through the blocks to get the logs even if no data is in the blocks, 
this is a lot slower.

## Tenderly

[Tenderly](https://tenderly.co/) has some very fast nodes and in internal testing with free nodes they blew everyone out the water
for returning the most event logs in the fastest time.

check out their free nodes here - https://docs.tenderly.co/supported-networks-and-languages

:::info
Keep in mind that the public RPC are rate limited.

For production use, itâ€™s recommended use a dedicated Node RPC.

## Alchemy

[Alchemy](https://www.alchemy.com/) is another great provider with a free tier that is generous.

## Other top providers

Infura and thirdweb are also good providers. 

## All other networks

You can use [chainlist](https://chainlist.org/) to find all the providers which support your network.

## Local nodes

rindexer should work with any local nodes you run including [Anvil](https://book.getfoundry.sh/anvil/) and [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/)

## RPC Proxy and Caching

[eRPC](https://github.com/erpc/erpc) is a fault-tolerant EVM RPC proxy and re-org aware permanent caching solution. It is built with read-heavy use-cases in mind such as data indexing and high-load frontend usage.

### Setup

1. Create your [`erpc.yaml`](https://docs.erpc.cloud/config/example) configuration file:

```yaml filename="erpc.yaml"
logLevel: debug
projects:
  - id: main
    upstreams:
      # You don't need to define architecture (e.g. evm) or chain id (e.g. 137)
      # as they will be detected automatically by eRPC.
      - endpoint: https://eth-mainnet.blastapi.io/xxxx
      - endpoint: https://polygon-mainnet.blastapi.io/xxxx
      - endpoint: evm+alchemy://xxxx-my-alchemy-api-key-xxxx
```

See [a complete config example](https://docs.erpc.cloud/config/example) for inspiration.

2. Use the Docker image:

```bash
docker run -v $(pwd)/erpc.yaml:/root/erpc.yaml -p 4000:4000 -p 4001:4001 ghcr.io/erpc/erpc:latest
```

or add the below configs to the rindexer's [docker-compose.yaml](https://github.com/joshstevens19/rindexer/blob/master/docker-compose.yml) as a service and run `docker-compose up -d`:

```yaml [rindexer.yaml]
  services:
    ...

    erpc: // [!code focus]
      image: ghcr.io/erpc/erpc:latest // [!code focus]
      platform: linux/amd64 // [!code focus]
      volumes: // [!code focus]
        - ${PROJECT_PATH}/erpc.yaml:/root/erpc.yaml // [!code focus]
      ports: // [!code focus]
        - 4000:4000 // [!code focus]
        - 4001:4001 // [!code focus]
      restart: always // [!code focus]
```

3. Set erpc url in [rindexer network config](https://rindexer.xyz/docs/start-building/yaml-config/networks#rpc):

```yaml [rindexer.yaml]
name: rETHIndexer
description: My first rindexer project
repository: https://github.com/joshstevens19/rindexer
project_type: no-code
networks:
- name: ethereum
  chain_id: 1
  rpc: http://erpc:4000/main/evm/1 // [!code focus]
```

and you are set to go. the rpc requests now will be redirected toward erpc and it will handle caching, failover, auto-batching, rate-limiting, auto-discovery of node providers, etc. behind the scenes.
