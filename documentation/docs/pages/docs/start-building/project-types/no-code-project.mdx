# No-code Project

The No-code Project type in rindexer is designed for users who wish to quickly set up and deploy indexing solutions without delving into
the complexities of coding. This project type leverages a YAML-based configuration that guides you through specifying what data to index and
how to index it. It's an ideal solution for those who need to implement standard indexing tasks, or for developers who prefer to focus more
on application logic than on the intricacies of the indexing process.

:::tip[Custom Tables - Build Powerful Indexers Without Code]
With **Custom Tables**, you can build sophisticated indexers that maintain derived state -
like token balances, NFT ownership, and protocol metrics - all without writing any code.
Track ERC20 balances, count user actions, aggregate cross-chain data, and more.

:::

**Features:**
- **Easy Configuration**: Set up your indexing with a simple YAML file. Define what chain events to listen
for and how they should be processed with just a few lines of configuration.
- **Custom Tables**: Maintain derived state like token balances, NFT ownership, counters, and cross-chain
aggregations with upsert, update, and delete operations - no code required.
- **Quick Deployment**: With the no-code setup, your project can be up and running in minutes. This rapid deployment
allows you to see results quickly and make adjustments as needed without digging into code.
- **Focus on Use Cases**: This project type is perfect for use cases that don't require specialised processing of the data.
It allows you to focus on the application's functionality rather than on the backend logistics of data handling.

**Ideal For:**
- Token balance tracking (ERC20, ERC721, ERC1155).
- NFT ownership indexing.
- Protocol analytics (TVL, volume, user counts).
- Cross-chain aggregations.
- Data reporting and dashboards.
- Fast prototyping and MVP developments.
- Hackathons and quick proof-of-concept projects.

The no-code project functionality will keep growing and evolving to provide more features and capabilities to users who prefer a
configuration-driven approach to indexing. Any suggestions for no-code indexing ideas please create a github issue and we will look into it.
