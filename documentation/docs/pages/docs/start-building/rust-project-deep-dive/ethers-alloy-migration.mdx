# Ethers to Alloy Migration Guide

Rindexer released a breaking change for all Rust projects, which internally migrates from ethers to alloy.

This means that exposed types and primitives are now from Alloy rather than Ethers-rs; some methods have also been
deprecated and this will require breaking changes to be implemented within any rindexer rust project.

The simple steps to take are as follows:

1. Add `alloy` to your `Cargo.toml`
2. Run `rindexer codegen typings` to get the latest codegen state
3. Change all parameter names and types
4. Change advanced methods

You can see more details on each section below.

## 1. Add `alloy` to your `Cargo.toml`

First you should add `alloy` to your `Cargo.toml` and delete `ethers`.  You can now remove any references to the `ethers` crate and replace
this will the newer `alloy` crate. It should be pegged to the same version used by `rindexer` internally to ensure type compatibility.

Replace in `Cargo.toml`
```diff
- ethers = "2.0.14"
+ alloy = { version = "0.15.11", features = ["full"] }
```

Then any references to ethers types in your own code can be replaced with the alloy types. You can read more
in the [migration docs](https://alloy.rs/migrating-from-ethers/reference/).

```diff
- use ethers::prelude::U256;
+ use alloy::primitives::U256;
```

## 2. Run `rindexer codegen typings` to get the latest codegen state

Once you have added the `alloy` crate and changed any of your project-specific code uses you can now run the rindexer
codegen with `rindexer codegen typings`. This will regenerate the bindings with alloy code and types.

:::warn
If for some reason there are errors in your codegen file, please try deleting it before re-running. Otherwise raise an
issue on github: https://github.com/joshstevens19/rindexer/issues.
:::

This should lead to working error-free code in the codegen directory. At this point you should expect to errors in most
of the actual custom indexing files if you have specified them. This is mainly due to the reasons below (parameter name
changes & type changes).

## 3. Change all parameter names and types

You must now go through and deal with the errors in your specific handler functions. These will almost exclusively be
related to casing changes i.e. `token_id` -> `tokenId`. Or it will be a type's name change, i.e `H256` -> `B256`.

This should be relatively self explanatory, you can read more details below but it's just a simple manual process.

**Solidity contract parameters**

The casing of solidity contract parameters is now transparent, meaning the prior `snake_case` conversion will no longer
be retained and instead you will be required to access an event parameter by it's source name.

This will typically be `camelCase` or occasionally `UPPERCASE`, the rust compiler will help with this and the conversion
should be relatively simple, albeit it a manual process.

```diff
- EthereumSqlTypeWrapper::AddressBytes(t.event_data.on_behalf_of),
+ EthereumSqlTypeWrapper::AddressBytes(t.event_data.onBehalfOf),
```

**Solidity types**

The core `EthereumSqlTypeWrapper` have been ported to use the new alloy primitives internally, so if you are manually
passing any `ethers` types such as the `Address` derived manually (i.e. not as an automatically exposed type from rindexer)
then you will need ensure this is migrated to the new types.

Most simple types can be found in the alloy migration guide: https://alloy.rs/migrating-from-ethers/reference/

The most common types which experiences the rename are the `Hash` types, renamed to `Byte` types:
- `H256` -> `B256`
- `H128` -> `B128`
- `H256` -> `B256`
- `H512` -> `B512`

The above includes all Vec, and Byte representation variants e.g. `VecB512`, etc.

The following types have been retained but should be consisted deprecated and may be removed:
- `H160` -> Use `Address` types instead (Including all Vec, and Byte representation variants)

:::warn
A simple find and replace should handle most of these cases
:::

## 4. Change advanced methods

:::warn
Most projects will by default use the underlying type, this is for when manual type manipulation is needed.
:::

The final step may be to replace any methods that are erroring out, that previously were not. The most common of this
will be the existence of `as_u[BITS]`.

These methods are no longer exposed directly on all solidity primitive `uint` types. For example the `as_u32()` method
which existed on a `U256` is no longer directly accessible.

Instead now, if you wish to downcast, you can use the `TryInto` trait on most `uint` types to achieve the same outcome and
handle errors gracefully in the event of an overflow (where before a panic would occur implicitly).

```diff
- EthereumSqlTypeWrapper::U32(t.tx_information.log_index.as_u32()),
+ EthereumSqlTypeWrapper::U32(t.tx_information.log_index.try_into().expect("log_index should fit in u32")),
```

You may also opt to match the underlying type

```diff
- EthereumSqlTypeWrapper::U32(t.tx_information.log_index.as_u32()),
+ EthereumSqlTypeWrapper::U256(t.tx_information.log_index),
```
