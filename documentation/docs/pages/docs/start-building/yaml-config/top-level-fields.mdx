# Top level fields

The top-level fields of the YAML configuration file.

## name

The name of the project

```yaml [rindexer.yaml]
name: rETHIndexer // [!code focus]
```

## description

:::info
This field is optional
:::

The description of the project

```yaml [rindexer.yaml]
name: rETHIndexer
description: My first rindexer project // [!code focus]
```

## repository

:::info
This field is optional
:::

The repository of the project

```yaml [rindexer.yaml]
name: rETHIndexer
description: My first rindexer project
repository: https://github.com/joshstevens19/rindexer // [!code focus]
```

## environment_path

By default rindexer will load the environment variables from the `.env` file in the root of the project.

You can override this by providing the path to the environment file you wish to use.

```yaml [rindexer.yaml]
name: rETHIndexer
description: My first rindexer project
repository: https://github.com/joshstevens19/rindexer
environment_path: "../../.env" // [!code focus]
```

## project_type

The rindexer project type

### no-code

```yaml [rindexer.yaml]
name: rETHIndexer
description: My first rindexer project
repository: https://github.com/joshstevens19/rindexer
project_type: no-code // [!code focus]
```

OR

### rust

```yaml [rindexer.yaml]
name: rETHIndexer
description: My first rindexer project
repository: https://github.com/joshstevens19/rindexer
project_type: rust // [!code focus]
```

## config

More advanced opt-in configuration parameters. [See more details](/docs/start-building/yaml-config/config).


### no-code

```yaml [rindexer.yaml]
name: rETHIndexer
description: My first rindexer project
repository: https://github.com/joshstevens19/rindexer
config:
  buffer: 2 // [!code focus]
  callback_concurrency: 4 // [!code focus]
```

## timestamps

Timestamps are `disabled` by default.

Opt-in to including timestamps in all rindexer logs. Optionally configure a sample rate to improve
the efficiency of large-block-range requests by sampling those blocks. If you do not want to sample either ignore the option
or set it to `1.0`.

Any logs with timestamps already included are ignored, and we try to be as efficient as possible when fetching timestamps.

:::info
Sampling is tradeoff and cannot guarantee 100% accuracy of timestamps, but is far more efficient, whilst retaining high-accuracy.
:::

```yaml [rindexer.yaml]
name: rETHIndexer
description: My first rindexer project
repository: https://github.com/joshstevens19/rindexer
timestamps:
  enabled: true // [!code focus]
  sample_rate: 0.25 // [!code focus]
```
