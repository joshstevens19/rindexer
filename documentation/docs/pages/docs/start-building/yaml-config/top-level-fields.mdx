# Top level fields

The top-level fields of the YAML configuration file.

## name

The name of the project

```yaml [rindexer.yaml]
name: rETHIndexer // [!code focus]
```

## description

:::info
This field is optional
:::

The description of the project

```yaml [rindexer.yaml]
name: rETHIndexer
description: My first rindexer project // [!code focus]
```

## repository

:::info
This field is optional
:::

The repository of the project

```yaml [rindexer.yaml]
name: rETHIndexer
description: My first rindexer project
repository: https://github.com/joshstevens19/rindexer // [!code focus]
```

## environment_path

By default rindexer will load the environment variables from the `.env` file in the root of the project.

You can override this by providing the path to the environment file you wish to use.

```yaml [rindexer.yaml]
name: rETHIndexer
description: My first rindexer project
repository: https://github.com/joshstevens19/rindexer
environment_path: "../../.env" // [!code focus]
```

## project_type

The rindexer project type

### no-code

```yaml [rindexer.yaml]
name: rETHIndexer
description: My first rindexer project
repository: https://github.com/joshstevens19/rindexer
project_type: no-code // [!code focus]
```

OR

### rust

```yaml [rindexer.yaml]
name: rETHIndexer
description: My first rindexer project
repository: https://github.com/joshstevens19/rindexer
project_type: rust // [!code focus]
```

## config

More advanced opt-in configuration parameters. [See more details](/docs/start-building/yaml-config/config).


### no-code

```yaml [rindexer.yaml]
name: rETHIndexer
description: My first rindexer project
repository: https://github.com/joshstevens19/rindexer
config:
  buffer: 2 // [!code focus]
  callback_concurrency: 4 // [!code focus]
```

## timestamps

Enable block timestamps for all events on all networks. Timestamps are `disabled` by default.

Includes timestamps in all rindexer logs. Any logs with timestamps already included are ignored, and we
try to be as efficient as possible when fetching timestamps by first using fixed ranges, then precalculated, and
lastly fallback to RPC requests when required.

Timestamps can also be opted into for specific events. [See more details](/docs/start-building/yaml-config/contracts).

```yaml [rindexer.yaml]
name: rETHIndexer
description: My first rindexer project
repository: https://github.com/joshstevens19/rindexer
timestamps: true
```
