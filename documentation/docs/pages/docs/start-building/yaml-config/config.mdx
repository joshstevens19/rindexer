# Configuration Parameters

More advanced configuration options for fine-tuning memory usage, event throughput, and more. Most of the time you will
not need to adjust these values.

### Useful background

It is useful to become familiar with how rindexer controls concurrency across events and networks.

By nature of blockchain indexing, we must index events separately per network. However, we also try to
optimize throughput via `eth_getLogs` requests **per event**.

This means we ultimately run an indexing process per "network-event".

:::info
This "network-event" is where concurrency is controlled.
:::

## Buffer

_Default: `4`_

This parameter controls "buffer" of events we will hold in memory, per "network-event". This is extremely useful for
limiting the upper memory-bound during large scale backfill operations for high-frequency events (like ERC20 transfers).

What happens if the handler does not release events as fast as they can queried? Well,a backlog of events we've indexed
would build up in memory and ultimately the process would OOM and be killed.

We avoid that by maintaining a bounded channel (buffer) of events. This way when the handler is ready it will pull the
next event, and it will trigger a new indexing fetch to fill the freed slot.

The default should be enough to balance memory use with high-throughput, however can be tweaked to constrain memory by
lowering the value. Or potentially increasing throughput by increasing the value.

:::info
This concept is known as "back-pressuring".

```yaml [rindexer.yaml]
name: rIndexer
description: My native transfers rindexer project
repository: https://github.com/joshstevens19/rindexer
config:
  buffer: 1 // [!code focus]
```

## Callback Concurrency

_Default: `2`_

:::warn
When "index_event_in_order" is enabled for an event, it will override this setting with `1` to ensure FIFO ordering.
:::

This setting controls the "network-event" handler callback rate. This allows us to have `n` concurrent handlers being
called per "network event". This may or may not be desirable based on the use-case and code present in the handler callback function.

A case where this may not be desirable is if there is any kind of "per network-event global locking" which would mean that
trying to run 2 batches in parallel would simply result in one batch holding the other up.

Imagine setting this to some very high number, `999999`, representing unbounded concurrency. In this case
you can imagine that there is essentially no "back-pressure". This would work in the case where events are simply being
discarded, being maintained in memory, or some other hyper-efficient mechanism. But in reality, the most common case for
indexing will be to persist the events to a database, and in these cases there are factors such as data structure locks,
database connection pool limits, and resource constraints.

This means we cannot reasonably benefit from increasing this number too high, and on the contrary, can suffer a decrease
in throughput due to lock contention, and unwanted situations like connection pool exhaustion, deadlocks, and more.

You may benefit from increasing this above `2` for very simple workloads, generally a value of `1` or `2` is optimal.
