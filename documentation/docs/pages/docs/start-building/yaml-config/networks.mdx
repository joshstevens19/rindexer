# networks

Networks YAML config describes the networks you wish to enable.

:::info
You can have multiple networks in a single YAML file.
:::

## Fields

### name

The name of the network it should be unique to the YAML so you can not have 2 networks with the same name in the same
YAML file.

```yaml [rindexer.yaml]
name: rETHIndexer
description: My first rindexer project
repository: https://github.com/joshstevens19/rindexer
project_type: no-code
networks:
- name: ethereum // [!code focus]
```

### chain_id

The chainId of the network.

```yaml [rindexer.yaml]
name: rETHIndexer
description: My first rindexer project
repository: https://github.com/joshstevens19/rindexer
project_type: no-code
networks:
- name: ethereum
  chain_id: 1 // [!code focus]
```

### rpc

The rpc url for the network.

```yaml [rindexer.yaml]
name: rETHIndexer
description: My first rindexer project
repository: https://github.com/joshstevens19/rindexer
project_type: no-code
networks:
- name: ethereum
  chain_id: 1
  kind: Rpc
  rpc: https://mainnet.gateway.tenderly.co // [!code focus]
```

You can use [erpc](https://rindexer.xyz/docs/references/rpc-node-providers#rpc-proxy-and-caching) for load-balancing between multiple rpc endpoints (with failover, re-org aware caching, auto-batching, rate-limiters, auto-discovery of node providers, etc.)

```yaml [rindexer.yaml]
name: rETHIndexer
description: My first rindexer project
repository: https://github.com/joshstevens19/rindexer
project_type: no-code
networks:
- name: ethereum
  chain_id: 1
  rpc: http://erpc:4000/main/evm/1 // [!code focus]
```

We advise using environment variables for the rpc url to avoid checking in sensitive information.

```yaml [rindexer.yaml]
name: rETHIndexer
description: My first rindexer project
repository: https://github.com/joshstevens19/rindexer
project_type: no-code
networks:
- name: ethereum
  chain_id: 1
  rpc: ${ETHEREUM_RPC} // [!code focus]
```

You can read more about environment variables in the [Environment Variables](/docs/start-building/yaml-config#environment-variables) section.

### max_block_range

:::info
This field is optional and will slow down indexing if applied, rindexer is fastest when you use a RPC provider who can predict the next block ranges when fetching logs.
You can read a bit more about RPC providers [here](/docs/references/rpc-node-providers#rpc-node-providers).
:::

Set the max block range for the network, this means when rindexer is fetching logs it will not fetch more than the max block range per request.

```yaml [rindexer.yaml]
name: rETHIndexer
description: My first rindexer project
repository: https://github.com/joshstevens19/rindexer
project_type: no-code
networks:
- name: ethereum
  chain_id: 1
  kind: Rpc
  rpc: https://mainnet.gateway.tenderly.co
  max_block_range: 10000 // [!code focus]
```

### compute_units_per_second

:::info
This field is optional
:::

The compute units per second for the network.

```yaml [rindexer.yaml]
name: rETHIndexer
description: My first rindexer project
repository: https://github.com/joshstevens19/rindexer
project_type: no-code
networks:
- name: ethereum
  chain_id: 1
  kind: Rpc
  rpc: https://mainnet.gateway.tenderly.co
  compute_units_per_second: 660 // [!code focus]
```

### disable_logs_bloom_checks

:::warning
This field is optional and should only be turned on if you know what you are doing.

You should only enable this if you are using a chain which does not have support for logs blooms. Logs blooms
allow you to be able to skip calling `eth_getLogs` on blocks which do not contain the events you care about,
this is a huge performance gain for the indexer alongside a saving on the RPC bill.

If you are using a chain which does not support logs blooms you can enable this to skip the bloom checks.
:::

```yaml [rindexer.yaml]
name: rETHIndexer
description: My first rindexer project
repository: https://github.com/joshstevens19/rindexer
project_type: no-code
networks:
- name: ethereum
  chain_id: 1
  kind: Rpc
  rpc: https://mainnet.gateway.tenderly.co
  disable_logs_bloom_checks: true // [!code focus]
```

## Multiple Networks

You can have as many networks as you want in the YAML file.

```yaml [rindexer.yaml]
name: rETHIndexer
description: My first rindexer project
repository: https://github.com/joshstevens19/rindexer
project_type: no-code
networks: // [!code focus]
- name: ethereum // [!code focus]
  chain_id: 1 // [!code focus]
  kind: Rpc // [!code focus]
  rpc: https://mainnet.gateway.tenderly.co // [!code focus]
- name: base // [!code focus]
  chain_id: 8453 // [!code focus]
  rpc: https://mainnet.base.org // [!code focus]
```
