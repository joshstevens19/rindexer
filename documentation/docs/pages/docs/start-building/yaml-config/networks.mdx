# networks

Networks YAML config describes the networks you wish to enable.

:::info
You can have multiple networks in a single YAML file.
:::

## Fields

### name

The name of the network it should be unique to the YAML so you can not have 2 networks with the same name in the same
YAML file.

```yaml [rindexer.yaml]
name: rETHIndexer
description: My first rindexer project
repository: https://github.com/joshstevens19/rindexer
project_type: no-code
networks:
- name: ethereum // [!code focus]
```

### chain_id

The chainId of the network.

```yaml [rindexer.yaml]
name: rETHIndexer
description: My first rindexer project
repository: https://github.com/joshstevens19/rindexer
project_type: no-code
networks:
- name: ethereum
  chain_id: 1 // [!code focus]
```

### rpc

The rpc url for the network.

```yaml [rindexer.yaml]
name: rETHIndexer
description: My first rindexer project
repository: https://github.com/joshstevens19/rindexer
project_type: no-code
networks:
- name: ethereum
  chain_id: 1
  rpc: https://mainnet.gateway.tenderly.co // [!code focus]
```

We advise using environment variables for the rpc url to avoid checking in sensitive information.

```yaml [rindexer.yaml]
name: rETHIndexer
description: My first rindexer project
repository: https://github.com/joshstevens19/rindexer
project_type: no-code
networks:
- name: ethereum
  chain_id: 1
  rpc: ${ETHEREUM_RPC} // [!code focus]
```

You can read more about environment variables in the [Environment Variables](/docs/start-building/yaml-config#environment-variables) section.

### compute_units_per_second

:::info
This field is optional
:::

The compute units per second for the network.

```yaml [rindexer.yaml]
name: rETHIndexer
description: My first rindexer project
repository: https://github.com/joshstevens19/rindexer
project_type: no-code
networks:
- name: ethereum
  chain_id: 1
  rpc: https://mainnet.gateway.tenderly.co
  compute_units_per_second: 660 // [!code focus]
```

## Multiple Networks

You can have as many networks as you want in the YAML file.

```yaml [rindexer.yaml]
name: rETHIndexer
description: My first rindexer project
repository: https://github.com/joshstevens19/rindexer
project_type: no-code
networks: // [!code focus]
- name: ethereum // [!code focus]
  chain_id: 1 // [!code focus]
  rpc: https://mainnet.gateway.tenderly.co // [!code focus]
- name: base // [!code focus]
  chain_id: 8453 // [!code focus]
  rpc: https://mainnet.base.org // [!code focus]
```
