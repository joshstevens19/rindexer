# networks

Networks YAML config describes the networks you wish to enable.

:::info
You can have multiple networks in a single YAML file.
:::

## Fields

### name

The name of the network it should be unique to the YAML so you can not have 2 networks with the same name in the same
YAML file.

```yaml [rindexer.yaml]
name: rETHIndexer
description: My first rindexer project
repository: https://github.com/joshstevens19/rindexer
project_type: no-code
networks:
- name: ethereum // [!code focus]
```

### chain_id

The chainId of the network.

```yaml [rindexer.yaml]
name: rETHIndexer
description: My first rindexer project
repository: https://github.com/joshstevens19/rindexer
project_type: no-code
networks:
- name: ethereum
  chain_id: 1 // [!code focus]
```

### rpc

The rpc url for the network.

```yaml [rindexer.yaml]
name: rETHIndexer
description: My first rindexer project
repository: https://github.com/joshstevens19/rindexer
project_type: no-code
networks:
- name: ethereum
  chain_id: 1
  rpc: https://mainnet.gateway.tenderly.co // [!code focus]
```

You can use [erpc](https://rindexer.xyz/docs/references/rpc-node-providers#rpc-proxy-and-caching) for load-balancing between multiple rpc endpoints (with failover, re-org aware caching, auto-batching, rate-limiters, auto-discovery of node providers, etc.)

```yaml [rindexer.yaml]
name: rETHIndexer
description: My first rindexer project
repository: https://github.com/joshstevens19/rindexer
project_type: no-code
networks:
- name: ethereum
  chain_id: 1
  rpc: http://erpc:4000/main/evm/1 // [!code focus]
```

We advise using environment variables for the rpc url to avoid checking in sensitive information.

```yaml [rindexer.yaml]
name: rETHIndexer
description: My first rindexer project
repository: https://github.com/joshstevens19/rindexer
project_type: no-code
networks:
- name: ethereum
  chain_id: 1
  rpc: ${ETHEREUM_RPC} // [!code focus]
```

You can read more about environment variables in the [Environment Variables](/docs/start-building/yaml-config#environment-variables) section.

### max_block_range

:::info
This field is optional and will slow down indexing if applied, rindexer is fastest when you use a RPC provider who can predict the next block ranges when fetching logs.
You can read a bit more about RPC providers [here](/docs/references/rpc-node-providers#rpc-node-providers).
:::

Set the max block range for the network, this means when rindexer is fetching logs it will not fetch more than the max block range per request.

```yaml [rindexer.yaml]
name: rETHIndexer
description: My first rindexer project
repository: https://github.com/joshstevens19/rindexer
project_type: no-code
networks:
- name: ethereum
  chain_id: 1
  rpc: https://mainnet.gateway.tenderly.co
  max_block_range: 10000 // [!code focus]
```

### block_poll_frequency

:::info
This field is optional and may slow down indexing if applied, this is an advanced setting to be used with caution.
:::

Set the block poll frequency for the network, this allows making a trade-off between RPC use and live indexing speed. The
default setting will aggressively poll new blocks to ensure that we index as quickly as possible.

This is not always wanted, and you can choose configure to use an rpc "optimized" version, or manually define the millisecond
polling rate per network, or alternatively, manually define a factor of the polling rate.

```yaml [rapid (default)]
name: rETHIndexer

  block_poll_frequency: 1000 // [!code focus] # Poll every 1000ms for the network
```

:::

### compute_units_per_second

:::info
This field is optional
:::

The compute units per second for the network.

```yaml [rindexer.yaml]
name: rETHIndexer
description: My first rindexer project
repository: https://github.com/joshstevens19/rindexer
project_type: no-code
networks:
- name: ethereum
  chain_id: 1
  rpc: https://mainnet.gateway.tenderly.co
  compute_units_per_second: 660 // [!code focus]
```

### get_logs_settings

:::info
This field is optional. It is an advanced setting to be used with caution.
:::

Advanced configuration options that allow fine-grained control of event fetching logic.

#### address_filtering

Specifies how events that require address filtering (one that use either address filter or factory filter) are fetched from the network.

Can be one of:
- with `max_address_per_get_logs_request` configuration _(default behaviour)_ - events are fetched with addresses filter, log fetching happens in batches that consist of addresses chunks up to the specified value. Useful when events are often happening, but there is no huge number of addresses that are being watched for. The default value is 1000 addresses, which fits most of the RPC provider limits.
- `in-memory` - all matching events are fetched and then filtered in memory by addresses. Useful when events are not happening often, but there are a huge number of addresses that are being watched for.

:::code-group

```yaml [with max_address_per_get_logs_request]
name: rETHIndexer
description: My first rindexer project
repository: https://github.com/joshstevens19/rindexer
project_type: no-code
networks:
- name: ethereum
  chain_id: 1
  rpc: https://mainnet.gateway.tenderly.co
  get_logs_settings:
    address_filtering:
      max_address_per_get_logs_request: 100000
```

```yaml [in-memory]
name: rETHIndexer
description: My first rindexer project
repository: https://github.com/joshstevens19/rindexer
project_type: no-code
networks:
- name: ethereum
  chain_id: 1
  rpc: https://mainnet.gateway.tenderly.co
  get_logs_settings:
    address_filtering: "in-memory"
```

:::

### disable_logs_bloom_checks

:::warning
This field is optional and should only be turned on if you know what you are doing.

You should only enable this if you are using a chain which does not have support for logs blooms. Logs blooms
allow you to be able to skip calling `eth_getLogs` on blocks which do not contain the events you care about,
this is a huge performance gain for the indexer alongside a saving on the RPC bill.

If you are using a chain which does not support logs blooms you can enable this to skip the bloom checks.
:::

```yaml [rindexer.yaml]
name: rETHIndexer
description: My first rindexer project
repository: https://github.com/joshstevens19/rindexer
project_type: no-code
networks:
- name: ethereum
  chain_id: 1
  rpc: https://mainnet.gateway.tenderly.co
  disable_logs_bloom_checks: true // [!code focus]
```

### multicall3_address

:::info
This field is optional. By default, rindexer uses the standard Multicall3 address which is deployed on 250+ chains.
:::

When using `$call()` in [custom tables](/docs/start-building/tables), rindexer automatically batches view calls using
[Multicall3](https://www.multicall3.com/) for significantly improved performance. This can reduce indexing time by 5-10x
when your tables use on-chain view calls.

The standard Multicall3 contract (`0xcA11bde05977b3631167028862bE2a173976CA11`) is deployed on most EVM chains.
See the [full deployment list](https://www.multicall3.com/deployments).

If your chain uses a different Multicall3 address, you can specify it:

```yaml [rindexer.yaml]
name: rETHIndexer
description: My first rindexer project
repository: https://github.com/joshstevens19/rindexer
project_type: no-code
networks:
- name: my_custom_chain
  chain_id: 12345
  rpc: https://rpc.mycustomchain.com
  multicall3_address: "0xYourCustomMulticall3Address" // [!code focus]
```

If Multicall3 is not available on a network, rindexer will automatically detect this and fall back to individual RPC calls.

### reth

:::warning
Reth mode requires running a Reth archive node and is intended for advanced users. For more information on setting up Reth, visit [reth's official documentation](https://reth.rs/run/ethereum).
:::

Configure rindexer to use a local reth node for indexing. This provides direct connection to Reth with minimal latency and native reorg handling.

```yaml [rindexer.yaml]
name: rETHIndexer
description: My first rindexer project
repository: https://github.com/joshstevens19/rindexer
project_type: no-code
networks:
- name: ethereum
  chain_id: 1
  rpc: https://mainnet.gateway.tenderly.co  # Fallback RPC
  reth: // [!code focus]
    enabled: true // [!code focus]
    logging: true // [!code focus]  # Show Reth logs in stdout
    cli_args: // [!code focus]
      - "--datadir /data/reth" // [!code focus]
      - "--http" // [!code focus]
      - "--full false" // [!code focus]  # Archive mode
      - "--authrpc.jwtsecret /path/to/jwt.hex" // [!code focus]
```

#### enabled

Enable or disable the reth integration for this network.

#### logging

Show Reth logs in stdout (useful for debugging).

#### cli_args

Array of Reth CLI arguments in "flag value" format. Common arguments include:

- `--datadir`: Path to the reth data directory
- `--authrpc.jwtsecret`: Path to the JWT secret file for authenticated RPC
- `--authrpc.port`: The port for the auth RPC server (default: 8551)
- `--full`: Whether to run as a full node (use `false` for archive node)
- `--http`: Enable HTTP RPC server

## Multiple Networks

You can have as many networks as you want in the YAML file.

```yaml [rindexer.yaml]
name: rETHIndexer
description: My first rindexer project
repository: https://github.com/joshstevens19/rindexer
project_type: no-code
networks: // [!code focus]
- name: ethereum // [!code focus]
  chain_id: 1 // [!code focus]
  rpc: https://mainnet.gateway.tenderly.co // [!code focus]
- name: base // [!code focus]
  chain_id: 8453 // [!code focus]
  rpc: https://mainnet.base.org // [!code focus]
```
