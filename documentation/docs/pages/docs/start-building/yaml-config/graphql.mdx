# graphql

To define some graphql settings you can use the `graphql` section of the YAML configuration file.

:::info
This is optional if you are happy with the default settings but worth knowing what you can configure.
:::

## port

You can use the `--port` flag when running to override the port number you want to use for the GraphQL server
but this yaml config allows you to set a default port number. By default if not set it will use port 3001.

```yaml
name: rETHIndexer
description: My first rindexer project
repository: https://github.com/joshstevens19/rindexer
project_type: no-code
networks:
- name: ethereum
  chain_id: 1
  rpc: https://mainnet.gateway.tenderly.co
storage:
  postgres:
    enabled: true
contracts:
  - name: RocketPoolETH
    details:
      - network: ethereum
        address: "0xae78736cd615f374d3085123a210448e74fc6393"
        start_block: 18600000
        end_block: 18718056
    abi: ./abis/RocketTokenRETH.abi.json
    include_events:
      - Transfer
      - Approval
graphql:
  port: 3001 // [!code focus]
```

## disable_advanced_filters

rindexer GraphQL supports [advanced filtering](/docs/accessing-data/graphql#filter) but these filters easily be abused and cause performance issues.
If you wish to disable advanced filtering you can set this to true. By default it is enabled so set as false.

```yaml
name: rETHIndexer
description: My first rindexer project
repository: https://github.com/joshstevens19/rindexer
project_type: no-code
networks:
- name: ethereum
  chain_id: 1
  rpc: https://mainnet.gateway.tenderly.co
storage:
  postgres:
    enabled: true
contracts:
  - name: RocketPoolETH
    details:
      - network: ethereum
        address: "0xae78736cd615f374d3085123a210448e74fc6393"
        start_block: 18600000
        end_block: 18718056
    abi: ./abis/RocketTokenRETH.abi.json
    include_events:
      - Transfer
      - Approval
graphql:
  disable_advanced_filters: true // [!code focus]
```

## filter_only_on_indexed_columns

When you end up having a database which has a lot of data querying that can become slow, indexes can help speed up the queries
and critical for the performance of the GraphQL server. By default rindexer lets you filter on any column even if it is
not indexed but this setting allows you to only exposed the ability to filter via GraphQL on the indexed columns.

You can define your own indexes in the [storage](/docs/start-building/yaml-config/storage#indexes) section of the YAML configuration file.

```yaml
name: rETHIndexer
description: My first rindexer project
repository: https://github.com/joshstevens19/rindexer
project_type: no-code
networks:
- name: ethereum
  chain_id: 1
  rpc: https://mainnet.gateway.tenderly.co
storage:
  postgres:
    enabled: true
contracts:
  - name: RocketPoolETH
    details:
      - network: ethereum
        address: "0xae78736cd615f374d3085123a210448e74fc6393"
        start_block: 18600000
        end_block: 18718056
    abi: ./abis/RocketTokenRETH.abi.json
    include_events:
      - Transfer
      - Approval
graphql:
  filter_only_on_indexed_columns: true // [!code focus]
```
