# Overview of the YAML Configuration File

The YAML configuration file is the heart of your rindexer project. It defines the project's name,
description, repository, and the contracts that will be used to index the data.
This file is used to set up the project and configure the indexing tasks that will be performed.

**YAML is case-sensitive, so make sure to use the correct case when defining the fields in the configuration file.**

:::info
YAML files can be mapped to environment variables to store sensitive information, such as RPC urls or other credentials.
The syntax for this in the YAML is `${ENV_VARIABLE_NAME}`.

## YAML structure

- [Top level fields](/docs/start-building/yaml-config/top-level-fields) - The top-level fields of the YAML configuration file.
- [Networks](/docs/start-building/yaml-config/networks) - The networks to listen for events on are defined in the YAML configuration file.
- [Storage](/docs/start-building/yaml-config/storage) - The storage configuration is defined in the YAML configuration file.
- [Contracts](/docs/start-building/yaml-config/contracts) - The indexers of the project are defined in the YAML configuration file.
- [GraphQL](/docs/start-building/yaml-config/graphql) - The GraphQL configuration is defined in the YAML configuration file.
- [Global](/docs/start-building/yaml-config/global) - The global events to listen for are defined in the YAML configuration file.

### Environment Variables

YAML files can be mapped to environment variables to store sensitive information, such as RPC urls or other credentials.
Alongside different environments mappings, allowing you to store different values for different environments.
The syntax for this in the YAML is `${ENV_VARIABLE_NAME}`. This can be used in ANY field in the YAML file.

example:

```yaml
name: rETHIndexer
description: My first rindexer project
repository: https://github.com/joshstevens19/rindexer
project_type: no-code
networks:
  - name: ethereum
    chain_id: 1
    rpc: ${RPC_URL} // [!code focus]
storage:
  postgres:
    enabled: true
contracts:
  - name: RocketPoolETH
    details:
    - network: ethereum
      address: "0xae78736cd615f374d3085123a210448e74fc6393"
      start_block: 18600000
      end_block: 18718056
    abi: ./abis/RocketTokenRETH.abi.json
    include_events:
      - Transfer
      - Approval
```

## Example YAML no-code configuration file

### For single contract address

Filter events for a specific address

#### Historic

```yaml
name: rETHIndexer
description: My first rindexer project
repository: https://github.com/joshstevens19/rindexer
project_type: no-code
networks:
  - name: ethereum
    chain_id: 1
    rpc: https://mainnet.gateway.tenderly.co
storage:
  postgres:
    enabled: true
contracts:
  - name: RocketPoolETH
    details:
    - network: ethereum
      address: "0xae78736cd615f374d3085123a210448e74fc6393"
      start_block: 18600000
      end_block: 18718056
    abi: ./abis/RocketTokenRETH.abi.json
    include_events:
      - Transfer
      - Approval
```

#### Live

No start or end block will index from all new blocks as they are produced live.

```yaml
name: rETHIndexer
description: My first rindexer project
repository: https://github.com/joshstevens19/rindexer
project_type: no-code
networks:
  - name: ethereum
    chain_id: 1
    rpc: https://mainnet.gateway.tenderly.co
storage:
  postgres:
    enabled: true
contracts:
  - name: RocketPoolETH
    details:
    - network: ethereum
      address: "0xae78736cd615f374d3085123a210448e74fc6393"
    abi: ./abis/RocketTokenRETH.abi.json
    include_events:
      - Transfer
      - Approval
```

#### Live and historic

No end block will index from the start block to the latest block then index all new blocks as they produced live.

```yaml
name: rETHIndexer
description: My first rindexer project
repository: https://github.com/joshstevens19/rindexer
project_type: no-code
networks:
  - name: ethereum
    chain_id: 1
    rpc: https://mainnet.gateway.tenderly.co
storage:
  postgres:
    enabled: true
contracts:
  - name: RocketPoolETH
    details:
    - network: ethereum
      address: "0xae78736cd615f374d3085123a210448e74fc6393"
      start_block: 18600000
    abi: ./abis/RocketTokenRETH.abi.json
    include_events:
      - Transfer
      - Approval
```

### For many contract addresses

Filter events for many contract addresses

#### Historic

```yaml
name: rETHIndexer
description: My first rindexer project
repository: https://github.com/joshstevens19/rindexer
project_type: no-code
networks:
  - name: ethereum
    chain_id: 1
    rpc: https://mainnet.gateway.tenderly.co
storage:
  postgres:
    enabled: true
contracts:
  - name: RocketPoolETH
    details:
    - network: ethereum
      address:
        - "0xae78736cd615f374d3085123a210448e74fc6393" // [!code focus]
        - "0x2FD5c1659A82E87217DF254f3D4b71A22aE43eE1" // [!code focus]
      start_block: 18600000
      end_block: 18718056
    abi: ./abis/RocketTokenRETH.abi.json
    include_events:
      - Transfer
      - Approval
```

### For address or addresses with indexed filter

Filter events for a specific address or array of addresses filtering on indexed fields.
You can read more about indexed fields [here](/docs/start-building/yaml-config/contracts#indexed_1-indexed_2-indexed_3).

```yaml
name: rETHIndexer
description: My first rindexer project
repository: https://github.com/joshstevens19/rindexer
project_type: no-code
networks:
  - name: ethereum
    chain_id: 1
    rpc: https://mainnet.gateway.tenderly.co
storage:
  postgres:
    enabled: true
contracts:
  - name: RocketPoolETH
    details:
    - network: ethereum
      address: "0xae78736cd615f374d3085123a210448e74fc6393"
      indexed_filters: // [!code focus]
        - event_name: Transfer // [!code focus]
          indexed_1: // [!code focus]
            - 0xd87b8e0db0cf9cbf9963c035a6ad72d614e37fd5 // [!code focus]
      start_block: 18600000
      end_block: 18718056
    abi: ./abis/RocketTokenRETH.abi.json
    include_events:
      - Transfer
      - Approval
```

### Filter for an event across all contracts

The historic, live and historic and live examples above can be used in every example. You can read more about
these terms [here](/docs/start-building/live-indexing-and-historic).

```yaml
name: rETHIndexer
description: My first rindexer project
repository: https://github.com/joshstevens19/rindexer
project_type: no-code
networks:
  - name: ethereum
    chain_id: 1
    rpc: https://mainnet.gateway.tenderly.co
storage:
  postgres:
    enabled: true
contracts:
  - name: TransferEvents
    details:
    - network: ethereum
      filter:
        event_name: Transfer
      start_block: 18600000
      end_block: 18718056
    abi: ./abis/ERC20.abi.json
```

### Filter for an event across all contracts against indexed values

The historic, live and historic and live examples above can be used in every example. You can read more about
these terms [here](/docs/start-building/live-indexing-and-historic).

```yaml
name: rETHIndexer
description: My first rindexer project
repository: https://github.com/joshstevens19/rindexer
project_type: no-code
networks:
  - name: ethereum
    chain_id: 1
    rpc: https://mainnet.gateway.tenderly.co
storage:
  postgres:
    enabled: true
contracts:
  - name: TransferEventForAddress
    details:
    - network: ethereum
      filter:
        event_name: Transfer
      indexed_filters:
         - event_name: Transfer
           indexed_1:
             - 0x4A1a2197f307222cD67A1762D9A352F64558d9Be
      start_block: 18600000
      end_block: 18718056
    abi: ./abis/ERC20.abi.json
```
