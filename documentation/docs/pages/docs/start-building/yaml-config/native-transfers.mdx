# Native Transfers

A special opt-in configuration for indexing native token transfers such as "ETH", in the form of "ERC20"-like transfer events.

You can expect the event to be defined as if you were indexing an ERC20 Transfer event.

:::warning
This is **experimental** functionality which has not yet been extensively tested in production.
:::

:::info
**IMPORTANT**: The `rpc` provider passed into the `networks` configuration must support the `trace_block` RPC method or `debug_traceBlockByNumber` RPC method. Not
all providers currently support this.
:::

Supported stream providers:

- [Simple](/docs/start-building/yaml-config/native-transfers#simple) - Simple opt-in (for csv, and postgres)
- [Complex](/docs/start-building/yaml-config/native-transfers#complex) - Complex indexing configuration with stream providers

# Simple

The "simple" opt-in is done via including the top level yaml `native_transfers: true`. This has a few special properties
and is designed to kickstart simple persistence based indexing of native transfers.

By default, this means:
- All networks defined in `networks` will be enabled for native transfer indexing
- All enabled `storage` options will be used
- Native transfers will be indexed in `live` mode, from the latest block onwards.

The event will be persisted to storage under the event name `NativeTransfer`.

```yaml [rindexer.yaml]
name: rIndexer
description: My native transfers rindexer project
repository: https://github.com/joshstevens19/rindexer
project_type: no-code
networks:
  - name: ethereum
    chain_id: 1
    # The rpc provider must support the `trace_block` rpc method in simple mode
    rpc: https://mainnet.gateway.tenderly.co  // [!code focus]
storage:
  postgres:
    enabled: true
native_transfers: true // [!code focus]
contracts: []
```

# Complex

The complex configuration is designed for more powerful configuration. Specifically if your use case is one of the following:
1. You want historical `native transfer` indexing
2. You want to use one of the `stream` or `chat` providers
3. You want to conditionally filter or alias the event name
4. You want to only opt-in to specific networks for `native transfer` events

If you provide any `networks` in the `native_transfers` config it is equivalent to setting `native_tranfers: true` and
you will be opted in to native transfer indexing for that network.

## networks

The network name to listen for events on, this should match the network name in the networks section of the YAML.

```yaml [rindexer.yaml]
name: rIndexer
description: My native transfers rindexer project
repository: https://github.com/joshstevens19/rindexer
project_type: no-code
networks:
  - name: ethereum
    chain_id: 1
    rpc: https://mainnet.gateway.tenderly.co
native_transfers:
  networks: // [!code focus]
    - network: ethereum // [!code focus]
contracts: []
```

### start_block

The block to start indexing from, you can use the deployed block if you wish to get everything.

:::info
This is optional but most people will want to use this, if you do not provide an start block it will index the data from now and then live index as new blocks
come in. Important to know this will NOT track last synced block and when you start and stop the indexer it will start from the latest block.
You can read more about this [here](/docs/start-building/live-indexing-and-historic).
:::

```yaml [rindexer.yaml]
name: rIndexer
description: My native transfers rindexer project
repository: https://github.com/joshstevens19/rindexer
project_type: no-code
networks:
  - name: ethereum
    chain_id: 1
    rpc: https://mainnet.gateway.tenderly.co
native_transfers:
  networks: // [!code focus]
    - network: ethereum
      start_block: 0 // [!code focus]
contracts: []
```

### end_block

:::info
This is optional, if you do not provide an end block it will index all the data and then live index as new blocks
come in. You can read more about this [here](/docs/start-building/live-indexing-and-historic).
:::

```yaml [rindexer.yaml]
name: rIndexer
description: My native transfers rindexer project
repository: https://github.com/joshstevens19/rindexer
project_type: no-code
networks:
  - name: ethereum
    chain_id: 1
    rpc: https://mainnet.gateway.tenderly.co
native_transfers:
  networks: // [!code focus]
    - network: ethereum
      start_block: 18600000
      end_block: 18718056 // [!code focus]
contracts: []
```

### method

:::info
This is optional, if you do not provide a method it will default to using `trace_block` as
it provides a `block_hash` in the response.
:::

The method field is an advanced option, and typically does not need to be defined. By default it 
will use `trace_block` and it is only recommended to manually override this in the event that your 
RPC provider does not have adequate support for `trace_block` (i.e. in the case of Alchemy L2 Support).

Valid options are: `debug_traceBlockByNumber` or `trace_block`.

### Multiple Networks

You can have multiple networks, this is useful if you must track native balances across a variety of networks.

```yaml [rindexer.yaml]
name: rIndexer
description: My native transfers rindexer project
repository: https://github.com/joshstevens19/rindexer
project_type: no-code
networks: // [!code focus]
  - name: ethereum // [!code focus]
    chain_id: 1 // [!code focus]
    rpc: https://mainnet.gateway.tenderly.co // [!code focus]
  - name: base // [!code focus]
    chain_id: 8453 // [!code focus]
    rpc: https://base.gateway.tenderly.co // [!code focus]
storage:
  postgres:
    enabled: true
native_transfers: // [!code focus]
  networks: // [!code focus]
    - network: ethereum // [!code focus]
      start_block: 18600000
      end_block: 18718056
    - network: base // [!code focus]
      start_block: 18118056
      end_block: 18918056
```

## reorg_safe_distance

Reorgs can happen on the chain, this is when a block is removed from the chain and replaced with another block.
This can cause issues with the indexer indexed state if you turn `reorg_safe_distance` on it will keep a safe distance from the live
latest block to avoid any reorg issues.

Note if you are doing live indexing you will need to handle more advanced reorgs, support for advanced reorgs
is in the backlog for rindexer.

:::info
This is optional if you do not provide this it will index the latest blocks as soon as it is available for `debug`
indexing by the provider.
:::

```yaml [rindexer.yaml]
name: rIndexer
description: My native transfers rindexer project
repository: https://github.com/joshstevens19/rindexer
project_type: no-code
networks:
  - name: ethereum
    chain_id: 1
    rpc: https://mainnet.gateway.tenderly.co
  - name: base
    chain_id: 8453
    rpc: https://base.gateway.tenderly.co
native_transfers: // [!code focus]
  networks:
    - network: ethereum
    - network: base
  reorg_safe_distance: true // [!code focus]
contracts: []
```

## generate_csv

If you wish to generate a CSV file of the indexed data you can turn this on. This will be ignored if you do not have
the CSV storage enabled. By default if this is not supplied and the CSV storage is enabled it will generate a CSV file.

:::info
This is optional if you do not provide this it will generate a CSV file if the CSV storage is enabled.
:::

```yaml [rindexer.yaml]
name: rIndexer
description: My native transfers rindexer project
repository: https://github.com/joshstevens19/rindexer
project_type: no-code
networks:
  - name: ethereum
    chain_id: 1
    rpc: https://mainnet.gateway.tenderly.co
native_transfers: // [!code focus]
  networks:
    - network: ethereum
  generate_csv: true // [!code focus]
contracts: []
```

## streams

The stream options for `native_transfers` is equivalent to contract event indexing with one exception.

All streams provided will have the `NativeTransfer` event enabled by default, so it does not need to be explicitly defined
unless special logic (e.g. aliasing event names) is desired.

:::info
You can configure streams to stream the data to other services, this is useful if you want to use other services
to index the data. You can read more about it [here](/docs/start-building/streams).
:::

## Simple stream definition

:::info
Notice we ___don't___ define `events` under the `topics` in this SNS stream example.
:::

That is because rindexer knows the single `NativeTransfer` event should be included by default.

```yaml [rindexer.yaml]
name: indexer
description: rindexer native transfers demo
project_type: no-code
networks:
  - name: ethereum
    chain_id: 1
    rpc: https://mainnet.gateway.tenderly.co
native_transfers:
  networks:
    - network: ethereum
      reorg_safe_distance: true
  streams:
    sns:
      aws_config:
        region: us-east-1
        access_key: ${AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID}
        secret_key: ${AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY}
      topics: // [!code focus]
        - topic_arn: arn:aws:sns:us-east-1:000000000000:ethereum-transfers // [!code focus]
          networks: // [!code focus]
            - ethereum // [!code focus]
contracts: []
```

## Explicit `events` definition

In this case, we want to explicitly configure the stream processing for the event.

:::info
In order to add additional stream-event config, we **MUST** define the event with the name `NativeTransfer`.
:::

```yaml [rindexer.yaml]
name: indexer
description: rindexer native transfers demo
project_type: no-code
networks:
  - name: ethereum
    chain_id: 1
    rpc: https://mainnet.gateway.tenderly.co
native_transfers:
  networks:
    - network: ethereum
      reorg_safe_distance: true
  streams:
    sns:
      aws_config:
        region: us-east-1
        access_key: ${AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID}
        secret_key: ${AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY}
      topics:
        - topic_arn: arn:aws:sns:us-east-1:000000000000:ethereum-transfers
          networks:
            - ethereum
          events: // [!code focus]
            - event_name: NativeTransfer // [!code focus]
              alias: ETHTransfer // [!code focus]
contracts: []
```

## chat

You can configure chat to send messages You can read more about it [here](/docs/start-building/chatbots).
