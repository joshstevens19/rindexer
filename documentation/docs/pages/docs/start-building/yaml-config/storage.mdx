# storage

Storage YAML config describes the storage providers you wish to enable.

:::info
YAML files can be used to store sensitive information, you can use environment variables to store this information.
The syntax for this in the YAML is `${ENV_VARIABLE_NAME}`.
:::

## postgres

If you wish to store the data in a postgres database you can enable the postgres storage.

:::info
This is optional if you do not wish to store the data in a postgres database you can leave this section out of your YAML.
:::

### Internal tables

When rindexer is running with postgres it uses the database to manage some internal state including the network and contract last seen block
and cached records of the yaml so it can remove old indexes and foreign keys in the database. You can see those tables in a schema called `rindexer_internal`
and should never be modified manually.

### Own connection string

If you are deploying the indexer or want to point to an external database you can supply your own 
connection string, to do this you have to change/define it the `.env` file.

```bash
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://[user[:password]@][host][:port][/dbname]
```

### enabled

If postgres is enabled or not, if you do not wish to use postgres you can set this to false or remove postgres from the storage completely.

```yaml [rindexer.yaml]
name: rETHIndexer
description: My first rindexer project
repository: https://github.com/joshstevens19/rindexer
project_type: no-code
networks:
- name: ethereum
  chain_id: 1
  rpc: https://mainnet.gateway.tenderly.co
storage:
  postgres:
    enabled: true // [!code focus]
```

### disable_create_tables

:::info
This is only relevant for the rust projects as no-code if postgres is enabled will have to create the tables.
:::

If you do not wish for rindexer to create the database tables for you automatically you can set this to true.
By default if will create the tables for you. When this is disabled it will not write the sql in the handlers for you either.
This field is optional and can be ignored if you do not need it.

```yaml [rindexer.yaml]
name: rETHIndexer
description: My first rindexer project
repository: https://github.com/joshstevens19/rindexer
project_type: no-code
networks:
- name: ethereum
  chain_id: 1
  rpc: https://mainnet.gateway.tenderly.co
storage:
  postgres:
    enabled: true
    disable_create_tables: true // [!code focus]
```

### indexes

When you end up having a database which has a lot of data querying that can become slow, indexes can help speed up the
queries and critical for the performance of the GraphQL server. By default rindexer lets you filter on any column even
if it is not indexed but here you can define the common filtering you are going to use in your application.

rindexer sees the ABIs as the source of truth and allows you to map against the information you should know about,
rindexer will generate all the SQL for you and naming based on this.

:::info
When you start up rindexer it will drop any old and new indexes and resync the historic data then apply them again before indexing the live data.
Having indexes in place when you writing data to the database can drastically slowdown indexing speed and writing speed to
the database.
:::

#### global_injected_parameters

:::info
This is optional
:::

rindexer will inject common parameters into the event tables for you:

- `contract_address` - The contract address of the event
- `tx_hash` - The transaction hash of the event
- `block_number` - The block number of the event
- `block_hash` - The block hash of the event
- `network` - The network of the event
- `tx_index` - The transaction index of the event
- `log_index` - The log index of the event

If you start seeing your queries being slow when using any of these to filter you can add them to the `global_injected_parameters`
and rindexer will apply on all tables it generates.

For example below I want to filter on the block number and network and my queries are slow so i can add this index:

```yaml [rindexer.yaml]
name: rETHIndexer
description: My first rindexer project
repository: https://github.com/joshstevens19/rindexer
project_type: no-code
networks:
- name: ethereum
  chain_id: 1
  rpc: https://mainnet.gateway.tenderly.co
storage:
  postgres:
    enabled: true
    indexes: // [!code focus]
      global_injected_parameters: // [!code focus]
         - block_number // [!code focus]
         - network // [!code focus]
```

#### contracts

You can then define indexes for your contracts

##### name

As you can have multiple contracts in your project you have to map its name to the contracts so it can read the ABIs.

```yaml [rindexer.yaml]
name: rETHIndexer
description: My first rindexer project
repository: https://github.com/joshstevens19/rindexer
project_type: no-code
networks:
- name: ethereum
  chain_id: 1
  rpc: https://mainnet.gateway.tenderly.co
storage:
  postgres:
    enabled: true
    indexes: // [!code focus]
        contracts: // [!code focus]
          - name: LensHub // [!code focus]
```

##### injected_parameters

:::info
This is optional
:::

This is the same as [the global injected parameters](/docs/start-building/yaml-config/storage#global_injected_parameters)
but will only apply to the events of this contract.

```yaml [rindexer.yaml]
name: rETHIndexer
description: My first rindexer project
repository: https://github.com/joshstevens19/rindexer
project_type: no-code
networks:
- name: ethereum
  chain_id: 1
  rpc: https://mainnet.gateway.tenderly.co
storage:
  postgres:
    enabled: true
    indexes: // [!code focus]
        contracts: // [!code focus]
          - name: LensHub
            injected_parameters: // [!code focus]
                   - block_number // [!code focus]
                   - network // [!code focus]
```

##### events

You can define indexes for specific events in the contract. Events are tables and you can make this with the values
of the ABI and rindexer will transform them into the SQL queries you need. An event can have multiple indexes.

###### name

The name of the event to apply the indexes to.

```yaml [rindexer.yaml]
name: rETHIndexer
description: My first rindexer project
repository: https://github.com/joshstevens19/rindexer
project_type: no-code
networks:
- name: ethereum
  chain_id: 1
  rpc: https://mainnet.gateway.tenderly.co
storage:
  postgres:
    enabled: true
    indexes: // [!code focus]
        contracts: // [!code focus]
          - name: LensHub
            events: // [!code focus]
              - name: QuoteCreated // [!code focus]
```

###### injected_parameters

:::info
This is optional
:::

This is the same as [the global injected parameters](/docs/start-building/yaml-config/storage#global_injected_parameters)
but will only apply the single event.

```yaml [rindexer.yaml]
name: rETHIndexer
description: My first rindexer project
repository: https://github.com/joshstevens19/rindexer
project_type: no-code
networks:
- name: ethereum
  chain_id: 1
  rpc: https://mainnet.gateway.tenderly.co
storage:
  postgres:
    enabled: true
    indexes: // [!code focus]
        contracts: // [!code focus]
          - name: LensHub
            events: // [!code focus]
              - name: QuoteCreated
                injected_parameters: // [!code focus]
                  - tx_hash // [!code focus]
```

###### indexes

You can define your indexes here - this allows you to define many indexes for the same event.

We will use this ABI as an example as it has tuples as well as route inputs.

```json
{
    "anonymous": false,
    "inputs": [
      {
        "components": [
          {
            "internalType": "uint256",
            "name": "profileId",
            "type": "uint256"
          },
          {
            "internalType": "string",
            "name": "contentURI",
            "type": "string"

          },
          {
            "internalType": "address[]",
            "name": "actionModules",
            "type": "address[]"
          },
          {
            "internalType": "bytes[]",
            "name": "actionModulesInitDatas",
            "type": "bytes[]"
          },
          {
            "internalType": "address",
            "name": "referenceModule",
            "type": "address"
          },
          {
            "internalType": "bytes",
            "name": "referenceModuleInitData",
            "type": "bytes"
          }
        ],
        "indexed": false,
        "internalType": "struct Types.QuoteParams",
        "name": "quoteParams",

      },
      {
        "indexed": false,
        "internalType": "bytes",
        "name": "referenceModuleReturnData",
        "type": "bytes"
      },
      {
        "indexed": false,
        "internalType": "bytes[]",
        "name": "actionModulesInitReturnDatas",
        "type": "bytes[]"
      },
      {
        "indexed": false,
        "internalType": "bytes",
        "name": "referenceModuleInitReturnData",
        "type": "bytes"
      },
      {
        "indexed": false,
        "internalType": "address",
        "name": "transactionExecutor",
        "type": "address"
      },
      {
        "indexed": false,
        "internalType": "uint256",
        "name": "timestamp",
        "type": "uint256"
      }
    ],
    "name": "QuoteCreated",
    "type": "event"
}
```

###### event_input_names

You may want to index one field or you may which to use a composite that filter or sort by multiple columns.

###### single root field

Lets say i want to add an index for `transactionExecutor` I look in the ABI for that field and i see its not in a tuple
and directly on the root of inputs so i take the input name and apply it to the yaml file.

```json
 {
     ...
     "inputs": [
     ...
     {
        "indexed": false,
        "internalType": "address",
        "name": "transactionExecutor", // [!code focus]
        "type": "address"
      },
      ...
    ],
    "name": "QuoteCreated", // [!code focus]
    "type": "event"
  },
```

```yaml [rindexer.yaml]
name: rETHIndexer
description: My first rindexer project
repository: https://github.com/joshstevens19/rindexer
project_type: no-code
networks:
- name: ethereum
  chain_id: 1
  rpc: https://mainnet.gateway.tenderly.co
storage:
  postgres:
    enabled: true
    indexes: // [!code focus]
        contracts: // [!code focus]
          - name: LensHub
            events: // [!code focus]
              - name: QuoteCreated
            indexes: // [!code focus]
                - event_input_names: // [!code focus]
                    - transactionExecutor // [!code focus]
```

This will create a SQL index like the below:

```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_quote_created_transaction_executor
ON lens_indexer_lens_hub_quote_created (transaction_executor);
```

:::info
do not worry if you do not understand this all you need to care about is that you can now filter on `transaction_executor`) faster.
:::

###### tuple field

If you want to add an index in a field which is within a tuple you can do this easily by just mapping the object location.

Lets say i want to add an index on the `quoteParams` `referenceModule` field.

```json
  {
    "anonymous": false,
    "inputs": [
      {
        "components": [
          ...
          {
            "internalType": "address",
            "name": "referenceModule", // [!code focus]
            "type": "address"
          },
          ...
        ],
        "indexed": false,
        "internalType": "struct Types.QuoteParams",
        "name": "quoteParams", // [!code focus]
        "type": "tuple"
      },
      ...
    ],
    "name": "QuoteCreated",
    "type": "event"
  },
```

I would just map this in the yaml file:

```yaml [rindexer.yaml]
name: rETHIndexer
description: My first rindexer project
repository: https://github.com/joshstevens19/rindexer
project_type: no-code
networks:
- name: ethereum
  chain_id: 1
  rpc: https://mainnet.gateway.tenderly.co
storage:
  postgres:
    enabled: true
    indexes: // [!code focus]
        contracts: // [!code focus]
          - name: LensHub
            events: // [!code focus]
              - name: QuoteCreated
            indexes: // [!code focus]
                - event_input_names: // [!code focus]
                    - "quoteParams.referenceModule" // [!code focus]
```

This will create a SQL index like the below:

```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_quote_created_quote_params_reference_module
ON lens_indexer_lens_hub_quote_created (quote_params_reference_module);
```

:::info
do not worry if you do not understand this all you need to care about is that you can now filter on `transaction_executor`) faster.
:::

###### multiple indexed fields

You may want to index multiple fields if you are doing a filter or ordering on many fields. Composite indexes are supported
in the SQL database and you can do this easily by just mapping the object location.

:::info
Composite indexes are very powerful and can have very high performance on the SQL queries if you are filtering on many fields.
:::

Lets say i want to add an index on the `quoteParams` `referenceModule` field alongside the `transactionExecutor`.

```json
  {
    "anonymous": false,
    "inputs": [
      {
        "components": [
          ...
          {
            "internalType": "address",
            "name": "referenceModule", // [!code focus]
            "type": "address"
          },
          ...
        ],
        "indexed": false,
        "internalType": "struct Types.QuoteParams",
        "name": "quoteParams", // [!code focus]
        "type": "tuple"
      },
      {
        "indexed": false,
        "internalType": "address",
        "name": "transactionExecutor", // [!code focus]
        "type": "address"
      },
    ],
    "name": "QuoteCreated",
    "type": "event"
  },
```

I would just map this in the yaml file:

```yaml [rindexer.yaml]
name: rETHIndexer
description: My first rindexer project
repository: https://github.com/joshstevens19/rindexer
project_type: no-code
networks:
- name: ethereum
  chain_id: 1
  rpc: https://mainnet.gateway.tenderly.co
storage:
  postgres:
    enabled: true
    indexes: // [!code focus]
        contracts: // [!code focus]
          - name: LensHub
            events: // [!code focus]
              - name: QuoteCreated
            indexes: // [!code focus]
                - event_input_names: // [!code focus]
                    - transactionExecutor
                    - "quoteParams.referenceModule" // [!code focus]
```

This will create a SQL index like the below:

```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_quote_created_transaction_executor_quote_params_reference_module
ON lens_indexer_lens_hub_quote_created (transaction_executor, quote_params_reference_module);
```

:::info
do not worry if you do not understand this all you need to care about is that you can now filter on `transaction_executor`) faster.
:::

### relationships

:::warning
if you are using defined [dependency_events](/docs/start-building/yaml-config/contracts#dependency_events) and using relationships
you will need to make sure you define the relationship in the `dependency_events` manually as rindexer can not merge
the relationship with the dependency events if custom dependency_events are defined. If you do not define it within the
dependency_events FK constraints will be thrown.
:::

:::warning
Also note any cross contracts relationships will not be applied automatically, you will need to define them manually in the YAML.
if you do not rindexer will panic and let you know that you have to define the [dependency_events](/docs/start-building/yaml-config/contracts#dependency_events).
:::

You can define your relationships between events, this will add foreign keys to the database and also process them in
the correct order. Note rindexer always optimises for speed unless told to do so, on historic data it will drop any
foreign keys and run them concurrently, it then re-apply the relationships again before indexing the live data.
If still want to only run once the other one has run you can look into the [dependency events](/docs/start-building/yaml-config/contracts#dependency_events).

You can define many relationships in the same YAML file.

We will use these ABIs as an example as it has tuples as well as route inputs.

        "internalType": "uint256",
        "name": "profileId",
        "type": "uint256"
      },
      {
        "indexed": false,
        "internalType": "string",
        "name": "metadata",

        "type": "address"
      },
      {
        "indexed": false,
        "internalType": "uint256",
        "name": "timestamp",
        "type": "uint256"
      }
    ],
    "name": "ProfileMetadataSet",
    "type": "event"
}
```

:::

#### contract_name

As you can have multiple contracts in your project you have to map its name to the contracts so it can read the ABIs.

```yaml [rindexer.yaml]
name: rETHIndexer
description: My first rindexer project
repository: https://github.com/joshstevens19/rindexer
project_type: no-code
networks:
- name: ethereum
  chain_id: 1
  rpc: https://mainnet.gateway.tenderly.co
storage:
  postgres:
    enabled: true
    relationships: // [!code focus]
      - contract_name: LensHub // [!code focus]
```

#### event_name

The name of the event to apply the indexes to.

```yaml [rindexer.yaml]
name: rETHIndexer
description: My first rindexer project
repository: https://github.com/joshstevens19/rindexer
project_type: no-code
networks:
- name: ethereum
  chain_id: 1
  rpc: https://mainnet.gateway.tenderly.co
storage:
  postgres:
    enabled: true
    relationships: // [!code focus]
      - contract_name: LensHub
        event_name: QuoteCreated // [!code focus]
```

#### event_input_name

This can be a tuple object mapping or a single field which we explained both explained above.

Lets say we want to make `QuoteCreated` events `quoteParams.profileId` linked to something other profile id event.

```json [QuoteCreated ABI]
{
     "anonymous": false,
     "inputs": [
       {
         "components": [
           {
             "internalType": "uint256",
             "name": "profileId", // [!code focus]
             "type": "uint256"
           },
           ...
         ],
         "indexed": false,
         "internalType": "struct Types.QuoteParams",
         "name": "quoteParams", // [!code focus]
         "type": "tuple"
       },
       ...
     ],
     "name": "QuoteCreated",
     "type": "event"
}
```

Lets add that field to the `event_input_name`:

```yaml [rindexer.yaml]
name: rETHIndexer
description: My first rindexer project
repository: https://github.com/joshstevens19/rindexer
project_type: no-code
networks:
- name: ethereum
  chain_id: 1
  rpc: https://mainnet.gateway.tenderly.co
storage:
  postgres:
    enabled: true
    relationships: // [!code focus]
      - contract_name: LensHub
        event_name: QuoteCreated
        event_input_name: "quoteParams.profileId" // [!code focus]
```

#### linked_to

Now we have to map what this referenced to.

#### contract_name

Define the contract name to link to.

```yaml [rindexer.yaml]
name: rETHIndexer
description: My first rindexer project
repository: https://github.com/joshstevens19/rindexer
project_type: no-code
networks:
- name: ethereum
  chain_id: 1
  rpc: https://mainnet.gateway.tenderly.co
storage:
  postgres:
    enabled: true
    relationships:
      - contract_name: LensHub
        event_name: QuoteCreated
        event_input_name: "quoteParams.profileId"
        linked_to: // [!code focus]
          - contract_name: LensHub // [!code focus]
```

#### event_name

Define the event name to link to.

```yaml [rindexer.yaml]
name: rETHIndexer
description: My first rindexer project
repository: https://github.com/joshstevens19/rindexer
project_type: no-code
networks:
- name: ethereum
  chain_id: 1
  rpc: https://mainnet.gateway.tenderly.co
storage:
  postgres:
    enabled: true
    relationships:
      - contract_name: LensHub
        event_name: QuoteCreated
        event_input_name: "quoteParams.profileId"
        linked_to: // [!code focus]
          - contract_name: LensHub // [!code focus]
            event_name: ProfileMetadataSet // [!code focus]
```

#### event_input_name

Map the event input name for it, this MUST match the same ABI type as the event_input_name type above.

```json [ProfileMetadataSet ABI]
{
    "anonymous": false,
    "inputs": [
      {
        "indexed": true,
        "internalType": "uint256",
        "name": "profileId", // [!code focus]
        "type": "uint256"
      },
      {
        "indexed": false,
        "internalType": "string",
        "name": "metadata",
        "type": "string"
      },
      {
        "indexed": false,
        "internalType": "address",
        "name": "transactionExecutor",
        "type": "address"
      },
      {
        "indexed": false,
        "internalType": "uint256",
        "name": "timestamp",
        "type": "uint256"
      }
    ],
    "name": "ProfileMetadataSet",
    "type": "event"
}
```

```yaml [rindexer.yaml]
name: rETHIndexer
description: My first rindexer project
repository: https://github.com/joshstevens19/rindexer
project_type: no-code
networks:
- name: ethereum
  chain_id: 1
  rpc: https://mainnet.gateway.tenderly.co
storage:
  postgres:
    enabled: true
    relationships: // [!code focus]
      - contract_name: LensHub
        event_name: QuoteCreated
        event_input_name: "quoteParams.profileId"
        linked_to: // [!code focus]
          - contract_name: LensHub
            event_name: ProfileMetadataSet
            event_input_name: profileId // [!code focus]
```

That is it we have now linked the `QuoteCreated` events `quoteParams.profileId` to the `ProfileMetadataSet` events `profileId`.

```yaml [rindexer.yaml]
name: rETHIndexer
description: My first rindexer project
repository: https://github.com/joshstevens19/rindexer
project_type: no-code
networks:
- name: ethereum
  chain_id: 1
  rpc: https://mainnet.gateway.tenderly.co
storage:
  postgres:
    enabled: true
    relationships: // [!code focus]
      - contract_name: LensHub // [!code focus]
        event_name: QuoteCreated // [!code focus]
        event_input_name: "quoteParams.profileId" // [!code focus]
        linked_to: // [!code focus]
          - contract_name: LensHub // [!code focus]
            event_name: ProfileMetadataSet // [!code focus]
            event_input_name: profileId // [!code focus]
```

You can read more about how this changes the GraphQL ability to query the data [here](/docs/accessing-data/graphql#relationships).

## csv

If you wish to store the data in a CSV files you can enable the csv storage.

:::info
This is optional if you do not wish to store the data in a CSV files you can leave this section out of your YAML.
:::

### Last synced block state

When indexing with csv and postgres is disabled rindexer keeps the network and contract last seen block in a txt file within the
defined path the csv files will be written to, this is to ensure that if the indexer goes down it can pick up where it left off.
You can see those txt files under the csv path and in the contract names folder there is a folder called `last-synced-blocks`, each event will have
a txt file with the last seen block. If you are using csv and postgres is enabled the last seen block will be stored in the database.

### enabled

If csv is enabled or not, if you do not wish to use csv you can set this to false or remove csv from the storage completely.

```yaml [rindexer.yaml]
name: rETHIndexer
description: My first rindexer project
repository: https://github.com/joshstevens19/rindexer
project_type: no-code
networks:
- name: ethereum
  chain_id: 1
  rpc: https://mainnet.gateway.tenderly.co
storage:
  csv:
    enabled: true // [!code focus]
```

### path

:::info
This field is optional
:::

The path to store the CSV files, it should be a directory path, if it does not exist it will be created in the project directory
in folder called `generated_csv`.

```yaml [rindexer.yaml]
name: rETHIndexer
description: My first rindexer project
repository: https://github.com/joshstevens19/rindexer
project_type: no-code
networks:
- name: ethereum
  chain_id: 1
  rpc: https://mainnet.gateway.tenderly.co
storage:
  csv:
    enabled: true
    path: ./generated_csv // [!code focus]
```

### disable_create_headers

:::info
This is only relevant for the rust projects as no-code if csv is enabled it will have to csv headers for you.
:::

If you do not wish for rindexer to create csv headers for you automatically you can set this to true.
By default if will create the csv headers for you. When this is disabled it will not write the csv code in the handlers for you either.
This field is optional and can be ignored if you do not need it.

```yaml [rindexer.yaml]
name: rETHIndexer
description: My first rindexer project
repository: https://github.com/joshstevens19/rindexer
project_type: no-code
networks:
- name: ethereum
  chain_id: 1
  rpc: https://mainnet.gateway.tenderly.co
storage:
  csv:
    enabled: true
    path: ./generated_csv
    disable_create_headers: true // [!code focus]
```

## Multiple Storage Providers

You can have multiple storage providers in the YAML file.

```yaml [rindexer.yaml]
name: rETHIndexer
description: My first rindexer project
repository: https://github.com/joshstevens19/rindexer
project_type: no-code
networks:
- name: ethereum
  chain_id: 1
  rpc: https://mainnet.gateway.tenderly.co
storage: // [!code focus]
  postgres: // [!code focus]
    enabled: true // [!code focus]
  csv: // [!code focus]
    enabled: true // [!code focus]
```
