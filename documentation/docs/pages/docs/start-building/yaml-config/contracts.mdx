# Contracts

The list of contracts to index for this indexer.

:::info
You can have multiple contracts in an indexer.
:::

## name

This is the name of the contract to index, it will use this name on the database on tables it generates, alongside
on generated rust code if you are using the rust project.

```yaml [rindexer.yaml]
name: rETHIndexer
description: My first rindexer project
repository: https://github.com/joshstevens19/rindexer
project_type: no-code
networks:
  - name: ethereum
    chain_id: 1
    kind: Rpc
    rpc: https://mainnet.gateway.tenderly.co
storage:
  postgres:
    enabled: true
contracts: // [!code focus]
   - name: RocketPoolETH // [!code focus]
```

## details

The details for the contract mapping to the network and contract address.

### network

The network name to listen for events on, this should match the network name in the networks section of the YAML.

```yaml [rindexer.yaml]
name: rETHIndexer
description: My first rindexer project
repository: https://github.com/joshstevens19/rindexer
project_type: no-code
networks:
  - name: ethereum
    chain_id: 1
    kind: Rpc
    rpc: https://mainnet.gateway.tenderly.co
storage:
  postgres:
    enabled: true
contracts: // [!code focus]
  - name: RocketPoolETH
    details:
      - network: ethereum // [!code focus]
```

### address

:::info
The address or addresses of the contract or contracts to listen for events on. If you wish to use a `filter` you can leave this blank.
:::

The contract address to listen for events on.

```yaml [rindexer.yaml]
name: rETHIndexer
description: My first rindexer project
repository: https://github.com/joshstevens19/rindexer
project_type: no-code
networks:
  - name: ethereum
    chain_id: 1
    kind: Rpc
    rpc: https://mainnet.gateway.tenderly.co
storage:
  postgres:
    enabled: true
contracts: // [!code focus]
  - name: RocketPoolETH
    details:
      - network: ethereum
        address: "0xae78736cd615f374d3085123a210448e74fc6393" // [!code focus]
```

To listen to many contract addresses you can provide an array of addresses.

```yaml [rindexer.yaml]
name: rETHIndexer
description: My first rindexer project
repository: https://github.com/joshstevens19/rindexer
project_type: no-code
networks:
  - name: ethereum
    chain_id: 1
    kind: Rpc
    rpc: https://mainnet.gateway.tenderly.co
storage:
  postgres:
    enabled: true
contracts: // [!code focus]
  - name: RocketPoolETH
    details:
      - network: ethereum
        address:
          - "0xae78736cd615f374d3085123a210448e74fc6393" // [!code focus]
          - "0x2FD5c1659A82E87217DF254f3D4b71A22aE43eE1" // [!code focus]
```

### filter

:::info
This is optional, if you do not provide a filter `address` will be required above.
:::

If you wish to filter based on events only for example you want all transfer events from all contracts you can use the
filter.

:::warning
You currently cannot mix and match address and filter within the same contract definition.
This means if you want to index on a filter and with the same contract definition index on  
an address you will need to do 2 different contract definitions in the yaml file.
:::

#### event_name

The event name to filter on, it must match the ABI event name.

```yaml [rindexer.yaml]
name: rETHIndexer
description: My first rindexer project
repository: https://github.com/joshstevens19/rindexer
project_type: no-code
networks:
  - name: ethereum
    chain_id: 1
    kind: Rpc
    rpc: https://mainnet.gateway.tenderly.co
storage:
  postgres:
    enabled: true
contracts: // [!code focus]
  - name: ERC20Transfer
    details:
      - network: ethereum
        filter: // [!code focus]
          event_name: Transfer // [!code focus]
```

#### Index more then 1 filter for the contract

You can just pass in an array of events names to index on the filter.

```yaml [rindexer.yaml]
name: rETHIndexer
description: My first rindexer project
repository: https://github.com/joshstevens19/rindexer
project_type: no-code
networks:
  - name: ethereum
    chain_id: 1
    kind: Rpc
    rpc: https://mainnet.gateway.tenderly.co
storage:
  postgres:
    enabled: true
contracts: // [!code focus]
  - name: ERC20 // [!code focus]
    details:
      - network: ethereum
        filter: // [!code focus]
          - event_name: Transfer // [!code focus]
          - event_name: Approval // [!code focus]
```

### indexed_1, indexed_2, indexed_3

:::info
This is optional and can be used on both address and filter.
:::

Indexed means that these values will be stored in the topics field rather than the data field when the event gets fired off
and you can filter these out on the JSONRPC side so you only get the events you want.

In EVM you can have up to 3 indexed fields to filter on. The indexed 1,2,3 are based on the order they emitted in the event.
So if you have 3 indexed fields in the event you can filter on all 3 or 2 or 1 of them in any direction. Indexed fields are arrays so
you can filter many values in the indexed fields, the arrays are `OR` not `AND` filtering.

example ABI:

```json
{
    "anonymous":false,
    "inputs":[
      {
        "indexed":true, // [!code focus]
        "internalType":"address",
        "name":"owner",
        "type":"address"
      },
      {
        "indexed":true, // [!code focus]
        "internalType":"address",
        "name":"spender",
        "type":"address"
      },
      {
        "indexed":false, // [!code focus]
        "internalType":"uint256",
        "name":"value",
        "type":"uint256"
      }
    ],
    "name":"Approval", // [!code focus]
    "type":"event"
}
```

So this ABI says that the inputs `owner` and `spender` are indexed and can be filtered on. `value` is not
indexed so you can not filter on it.

For example if you wanted to get all the approvals for rETH for owner `0xd87b8e0db0cf9cbf9963c035a6ad72d614e37fd5`
and `0x0338ce5020c447f7e668dc2ef778025ce398266b` you could set the indexed filters like so:

```yaml [rindexer.yaml]
name: rETHIndexer
description: My first rindexer project
repository: https://github.com/joshstevens19/rindexer
project_type: no-code
networks:
  - name: ethereum
    chain_id: 1
    kind: Rpc
    rpc: https://mainnet.gateway.tenderly.co
storage:
  postgres:
    enabled: true
contracts: // [!code focus]
   - name: RocketPoolETH
     details:
       - network: ethereum
         address: "0xae78736cd615f374d3085123a210448e74fc6393"
         indexed_filters: // [!code focus]
           - event_name: Approval // [!code focus]
             indexed_1:
               - "0xd87b8e0db0cf9cbf9963c035a6ad72d614e37fd5" // [!code focus]
               - "0x0338ce5020c447f7e668dc2ef778025ce398266b" // [!code focus]
```

Another example using filters is if you wanted to get all the approvals for any token for owner `0xd87b8e0db0cf9cbf9963c035a6ad72d614e37fd5`
and `0x0338ce5020c447f7e668dc2ef778025ce398266b` you could set the indexed filters like so:

```yaml [rindexer.yaml]
name: rETHIndexer
description: My first rindexer project
repository: https://github.com/joshstevens19/rindexer
project_type: no-code
networks:
  - name: ethereum
    chain_id: 1
    kind: Rpc
    rpc: https://mainnet.gateway.tenderly.co
storage:
  postgres:
    enabled: true
contracts: // [!code focus]
   - name: RocketPoolETH
     details:
       - network: ethereum
         filter:
            event_name: Approval
         indexed_filters: // [!code focus]
           - event_name: Approval // [!code focus]
             indexed_1:
               - 0xd87b8e0db0cf9cbf9963c035a6ad72d614e37fd5 // [!code focus]
               - 0x0338ce5020c447f7e668dc2ef778025ce398266b // [!code focus]
```

### start_block

The block to start indexing from, you can use the deployed block if you wish to get everything.

:::info
This is optional but most people will want to use this, if you do not provide an start block it will index the data from now and then live index as new blocks
come in. Important to know this will NOT track last synced block and when you start and stop the indexer it will start from the latest block.
You can read more about this [here](/docs/start-building/live-indexing-and-historic).
:::


```yaml [rindexer.yaml]
name: rETHIndexer
description: My first rindexer project
repository: https://github.com/joshstevens19/rindexer
project_type: no-code
networks:
  - name: ethereum
    chain_id: 1
    kind: Rpc
    rpc: https://mainnet.gateway.tenderly.co
storage:
  postgres:
    enabled: true
contracts: // [!code focus]
  - name: RocketPoolETH
    details:
      - network: ethereum
        address: "0xae78736cd615f374d3085123a210448e74fc6393"
        start_block: 18600000 // [!code focus]
```

### end_block

:::info
This is optional, if you do not provide an end block it will index all the data and then live index as new blocks
come in. You can read more about this [here](/docs/start-building/live-indexing-and-historic).
:::

```yaml [rindexer.yaml]
name: rETHIndexer
description: My first rindexer project
repository: https://github.com/joshstevens19/rindexer
project_type: no-code
networks:
  - name: ethereum
    chain_id: 1
    kind: Rpc
    rpc: https://mainnet.gateway.tenderly.co
storage:
  postgres:
    enabled: true
contracts: // [!code focus]
  - name: RocketPoolETH
    details:
      - network: ethereum
        address: "0xae78736cd615f374d3085123a210448e74fc6393"
        start_block: 18600000
        end_block: 18718056 // [!code focus]
```


### Multiple Networks

You can have multiple networks for the same contract, this is useful if you have a contract that is deployed on multiple
networks.

```yaml [rindexer.yaml]
name: rETHIndexer
description: My first rindexer project
repository: https://github.com/joshstevens19/rindexer
project_type: no-code
networks: // [!code focus]
  - name: ethereum // [!code focus]
    chain_id: 1 // [!code focus]
    kind: Rpc // [!code focus]
    rpc: https://mainnet.gateway.tenderly.co // [!code focus]
  - name: base // [!code focus]
    chain_id: 8453 // [!code focus]
    rpc: https://base.gateway.tenderly.co // [!code focus]
storage:
  postgres:
    enabled: true
contracts: // [!code focus]
  - name: RocketPoolETH
    details: // [!code focus]
    - network: ethereum // [!code focus]
      address: "0xae78736cd615f374d3085123a210448e74fc6393" // [!code focus]
      start_block: 18600000 // [!code focus]
      end_block: 18718056 // [!code focus]
    - network: base // [!code focus]
      address: "0xba25348cd615f374d3085123a210448e74fa3333" // [!code focus]
      start_block: 18118056 // [!code focus]
      end_block: 18918056 // [!code focus]
```

## abi

The ABI of the contract pointing to the JSON file in the repository. It can be a relative path or a full path.

```yaml [rindexer.yaml]
name: rETHIndexer
description: My first rindexer project
repository: https://github.com/joshstevens19/rindexer
project_type: no-code
networks:
  - name: ethereum
    chain_id: 1
    kind: Rpc
    rpc: https://mainnet.gateway.tenderly.co
storage:
  postgres:
    enabled: true
contracts: // [!code focus]
  - name: RocketPoolETH
    details:
      - network: ethereum
        address: "0xae78736cd615f374d3085123a210448e74fc6393"
        start_block: 18600000
        end_block: 18718056
    abi: ./abis/RocketTokenRETH.abi.json // [!code focus]
```

### Many ABIs

If you need to use many ABIs in the single contract you can pass in an array 
this is useful if you have a contract which has several different implementations ABIs.

```yaml [rindexer.yaml]
name: rETHIndexer
description: My first rindexer project
repository: https://github.com/joshstevens19/rindexer
project_type: no-code
networks:
  - name: ethereum
    chain_id: 1
    rpc: https://mainnet.gateway.tenderly.co
storage:
  postgres:
    enabled: true
contracts: // [!code focus]
  - name: RocketPoolETH
    details:
      - network: ethereum
        address: "0xae78736cd615f374d3085123a210448e74fc6393"
        start_block: 18600000
        end_block: 18718056
    abi: 
      - ./abis/RocketTokenRETH.abi.json // [!code focus]
      - ./abis/RocketTokenRETH2.abi.json // [!code focus]
```

## include_events

The events you wish to include in the indexer.

:::info
This is optional if you do not provide this it will include all events in the ABI.
:::

```yaml [rindexer.yaml]
name: rETHIndexer
description: My first rindexer project
repository: https://github.com/joshstevens19/rindexer
project_type: no-code
networks:
- name: ethereum
  chain_id: 1
  kind: Rpc
  rpc: https://mainnet.gateway.tenderly.co
storage:
  postgres:
    enabled: true
contracts: // [!code focus]
  - name: RocketPoolETH
    details:
      - network: ethereum
        address: "0xae78736cd615f374d3085123a210448e74fc6393"
        start_block: 18600000
        end_block: 18718056
    abi: ./abis/RocketTokenRETH.abi.json
    include_events:  // [!code focus]
      - Transfer // [!code focus]
      - Approval // [!code focus]
```

## index_event_in_order

rindexer was built to be as fast as it can so any blocking processes holds indexing up, the more concurrency the better.
Any events which you wish to index in the order the events were emitted on that event in the contract can be put in this list.

The more you put in here the slower the indexer will be as it will have to wait for the previous events to be indexed
before it can index the next events.

:::info
This is optional if you do not provide this it will assume speed is more important than order.
:::

```yaml [rindexer.yaml]
name: rETHIndexer
description: My first rindexer project
repository: https://github.com/joshstevens19/rindexer
project_type: no-code
networks:
- name: ethereum
  chain_id: 1
  kind: Rpc
  rpc: https://mainnet.gateway.tenderly.co
storage:
  postgres:
    enabled: true
contracts: // [!code focus]
  - name: RocketPoolETH
    details:
      - network: ethereum
        address: "0xae78736cd615f374d3085123a210448e74fc6393"
        start_block: 18600000
        end_block: 18718056
    abi: ./abis/RocketTokenRETH.abi.json
    include_events:
      - Transfer
      - Approval
    index_event_in_order: // [!code focus]
      - Transfer // [!code focus]
      - Approval // [!code focus]
```

## dependency_events

:::warning
if you are using defined dependency_events and using [relationships](/docs/start-building/yaml-config/storage#relationships)
you will need to make sure you define the relationship in the `dependency_events` manually as rindexer can not merge
the relationship with the dependency events if custom dependency_events are defined.
:::

:::warning
Also note any cross contracts relationships will not be applied automatically, you will need to define them manually in the YAML.
if you do not rindexer will panic and let you know that you have to define the [dependency_events](/docs/start-building/yaml-config/contracts#dependency_events).
:::

rindexer was built to be as fast as it can so any blocking processes holds indexing up, the more concurrency the better.
Any events which depend on each other can be put in the `dependency_events` list, this will mean that they will be processes
in the order they are in the list.

- `events` = process these events
- `then` = after you processed the `events` above process these events

If you do not put an event in the `dependency_events` events then it will be deemed a non-blocking event and will be processed
as soon as it can.

:::info
This is optional if you do not provide this it will assume speed is more important than order.

```yaml [rindexer.yaml]
name: rETHIndexer
description: My first rindexer project

networks:
- name: ethereum
  chain_id: 1
  kind: Rpc
  rpc: https://mainnet.gateway.tenderly.co
storage:

contracts: // [!code focus]
  - name: RocketPoolETH
    details:
      - network: ethereum

        - Transfer // [!code focus]
      then:
        events:
          - Approval // [!code focus]
```

### Cross Contract Dependency Events

You can also define dependency events blocking across contracts, this is useful if you have many contracts which emit
data but are dependent on each other.

:::info
WrappedRocketPoolETH example below does not exist on the chain, this is just an example of how you can use dependency events.
:::

```yaml [rindexer.yaml]
name: rETHIndexer
description: My first rindexer project
repository: https://github.com/joshstevens19/rindexer
project_type: no-code
networks:
- name: ethereum
  chain_id: 1
  kind: Rpc
  rpc: https://mainnet.gateway.tenderly.co
storage:
  postgres:
    enabled: true
contracts: // [!code focus]
  - name: WrappedRocketPoolETH // [!code focus]
    details:
      - network: ethereum
        address: 0x2FD5c1659A82E87217DF254f3D4b71A22aE43eE8
        start_block: 18600000
        end_block: 18718056
    abi: ./abis/WrappedRocketTokenRETH.abi.json
    include_events: // [!code focus]
    - Approval // [!code focus]
  - name: RocketPoolETH
    details:
      - network: ethereum
        address: "0xae78736cd615f374d3085123a210448e74fc6393"
        start_block: 18600000
        end_block: 18718056
    abi: ./abis/RocketTokenRETH.abi.json
    include_events:
      - Transfer // [!code focus]
    dependency_events: // [!code focus]
      events:
        - Transfer // [!code focus]
      then:
        events:
          - contract_name: WrappedRocketPoolETH // [!code focus]
            event_name: Approval // [!code focus]
```

So now `WrappedRocketPoolETH` > `Approval` will not be processed until `RocketPoolETH` > `Transfer` is processed.


## reorg_safe_distance

Reorgs can happen on the chain, this is when a block is removed from the chain and replaced with another block.
This can cause issues with the indexer indexed state if you turn `reorg_safe_distance` on it will keep a safe distance from the live
latest block to avoid any reorg issues.

Note if you are doing live indexing you will need to handle more advanced reorgs, support for advanced reorgs
is in the backlog for rindexer.

:::info
This is optional if you do not provide this it will index the latest blocks instantly.

      - Approval
    reorg_safe_distance: true // [!code focus]
```

## generate_csv

If you wish to generate a CSV file of the indexed data you can turn this on. This will be ignored if you do not have
the CSV storage enabled. By default if this is not supplied and the CSV storage is enabled it will generate a CSV file.

:::info
This is optional if you do not provide this it will generate a CSV file if the CSV storage is enabled.

## streams

You can configure streams to stream the data to other services, this is useful if you want to use other services
to index the data. You can read more about it [here](/docs/start-building/streams).

## chat

You can configure chat to send messages You can read more about it [here](/docs/start-building/chatbots).
