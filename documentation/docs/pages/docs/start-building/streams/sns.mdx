# SNS / SQS

:::info
rindexer streams can be used without any other storage providers. It can also be used with storage providers.
:::

rindexer allows you to configure AWS SNS and AWS SQS to stream any data to. This goes under
the [contracts](/docs/start-building/yaml-config/contracts) section of the YAML configuration file.

Find out more about [Simple Notification Service](https://aws.amazon.com/sns/) and [Simple Queue Service](https://aws.amazon.com/sqs/)

## Configuration with rindexer

`sns` `topics` property accepts an array allowing you to split up the streams any way you wish.

## Example

```yaml [rindexer.yaml]
name: RocketPoolETHIndexer
description: My first rindexer project
repository: https://github.com/joshstevens19/rindexer
project_type: no-code
networks:
- name: ethereum
  chain_id: 1
  rpc: https://mainnet.gateway.tenderly.co
contracts:
- name: RocketPoolETH
  details:
  - network: ethereum
    address: "0xae78736cd615f374d3085123a210448e74fc6393"
    start_block: "18600000"
    end_block: "18600181"
  abi: "./abis/RocketTokenRETH.abi.json"
  include_events:
  - Transfer
  streams: // [!code focus]
    sns: // [!code focus]
      aws_config: // [!code focus]
        region: us-east-1 // [!code focus]

        secret_key: ${AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY} // [!code focus]
        # session_token is optional // [!code focus]
        session_token: ${AWS_SESSION_TOKEN} // [!code focus]
      topics: // [!code focus]
        - topic_arn: "arn:aws:sns:us-east-1:664643779377:test" // [!code focus]
          networks: // [!code focus]
            - ethereum // [!code focus]
          events: // [!code focus]
            - event_name: Transfer // [!code focus]
```

## Response

:::info
Note SNS/SQS may wrap the message body into their own object so the below is just what we send to the stream.
:::

The response sent to you is already decoded and parsed into a JSON stringify object.

- `event_name` - The name of the event
- `event_data` - The event data which has all the event fields decoded and the transaction information which is under `transaction_information`
- `network` - The network the event was emitted on

For example a transfer event would look like:

```json
{
    "event_name": "Transfer",
    "event_data": {
        "from": "0x0338ce5020c447f7e668dc2ef778025ce3982662",
        "to": "0x0338ce5020c447f7e668dc2ef778025ce3982662",
        "value": "1000000000000000000",
        "transaction_information": {
            "address": "0xae78736cd615f374d3085123a210448e74fc6393",
            "block_hash": "0x8461da7a1d4b47190a01fa6eae219be40aacffab0dd64af7259b2d404572c3d9",

            "log_index": "0",
            "network": "ethereum",
            "transaction_hash": "0x145c6705ffbf461e85d08b4a7f5850d6b52a7364d93a057722ca1194034f3ba4",

### events

This is an array of events you want to stream to this SNS topic.

#### event_name

This is the name of the event you want to stream to this SNS topic, must match the ABI event name.

```yaml [rindexer.yaml]
...
contracts:
- name: RocketPoolETH
  details:
  - network: ethereum
    address: "0xae78736cd615f374d3085123a210448e74fc6393"

  include_events:
  - Transfer
  streams: // [!code focus]
    sns: // [!code focus]
      aws_config:
        region: us-east-1
        access_key: ${AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID}
        secret_key: ${AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY}
        # session_token is optional
        session_token: ${AWS_SESSION_TOKEN}
      topics: // [!code focus]
        - topic_arn: "arn:aws:sns:us-east-1:664643779377:test"
          networks:
            - ethereum
          events: // [!code focus]
            - event_name: Transfer // [!code focus]
```

#### conditions

This accepts an array of conditions you want to apply to the event data before streaming to this SNS topic.

:::info
This is optional, if you do not provide any conditions all data will be streamed.
:::

You may want to filter on the stream based on the event data, if the event data has not got an index on the on the
solidity event you can not filter it over the logs. The `conditions` filter is here to help you with this,
based on your ABI you can filter on the event data.

rindexer has enabled a special syntax which allows you to define on your ABI fields what you want to filter on.

1. `>` - higher then (for numbers only)
2. `<` - lower then (for numbers only)
3. `=` - equals
4. `>=` - higher then or equals (for numbers only)
5. `<=` - lower then or equals (for numbers only)
6. `||` - or
7. `&&` - and

So lets look at an example lets say i only want to get transfer events which are higher then `2000000000000000000` RETH wei

```yaml [rindexer.yaml]
...
contracts:
- name: RocketPoolETH
  details:
  - network: ethereum
    address: "0xae78736cd615f374d3085123a210448e74fc6393"
    start_block: "18600000"
    end_block: "18600181"
  abi: "./abis/RocketTokenRETH.abi.json"
  include_events:
  - Transfer
  streams: // [!code focus]
    sns: // [!code focus]
      aws_config:
        region: us-east-1
        access_key: ${AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID}
        secret_key: ${AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY}
        # session_token is optional
        session_token: ${AWS_SESSION_TOKEN}
      topics: // [!code focus]
        - topic_arn: "arn:aws:sns:us-east-1:664643779377:test"
          networks:
            - ethereum
          events: // [!code focus]
            - event_name: Transfer
              conditions: // [!code focus]
                - "value": ">=2000000000000000000" // [!code focus]
```

We use the ABI input name `value` to filter on the value field, you can find these names in the ABI file.

```json
{
    "anonymous":false,
    "inputs":[
      {
        "indexed":true,
        "internalType":"address",
        "name":"from",
        "type":"address"
      },
      {
        "indexed":true,
        "internalType":"address",
        "name":"to",
        "type":"address"
      },
      {
        "indexed":false,
        "internalType":"uint256",
        "name":"value", // [!code focus]
        "type":"uint256"
      }
    ],
    "name":"Transfer",
    "type":"event"
}
```

You can use the `||` or `&&` to combine conditions.

```yaml [rindexer.yaml]
...
contracts:
- name: RocketPoolETH
  details:
  - network: ethereum
    address: "0xae78736cd615f374d3085123a210448e74fc6393"
    start_block: "18600000"
    end_block: "18600181"
  abi: "./abis/RocketTokenRETH.abi.json"
  include_events:
  - Transfer
  streams: // [!code focus]
    sns: // [!code focus]
      aws_config:
        region: us-east-1
        access_key: ${AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID}
        secret_key: ${AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY}
        # session_token is optional
        session_token: ${AWS_SESSION_TOKEN}
      topics: // [!code focus]
        - topic_arn: "arn:aws:sns:us-east-1:664643779377:test"
          networks:
            - ethereum
          events: // [!code focus]
            - event_name: Transfer
              conditions: // [!code focus]
                - "value": ">=2000000000000000000 && value <=4000000000000000000" // [!code focus]
```

You can use the `=` to filter on other aspects like the `from` or `to` address.

```yaml [rindexer.yaml]
...
contracts:
- name: RocketPoolETH
  details:
  - network: ethereum
    address: "0xae78736cd615f374d3085123a210448e74fc6393"
    start_block: "18600000"
    end_block: "18600181"
  abi: "./abis/RocketTokenRETH.abi.json"
  include_events:

        secret_key: ${AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY}
        # session_token is optional
        session_token: ${AWS_SESSION_TOKEN}
      topics: // [!code focus]
        - topic_arn: "arn:aws:sns:us-east-1:664643779377:test"
          networks:
            - ethereum
          events: // [!code focus]
            - event_name: Transfer
              conditions: // [!code focus]
                - "from": "0x0338ce5020c447f7e668dc2ef778025ce3982662 || 0x0338ce5020c447f7e668dc2ef778025ce398266u" // [!code focus]
                - "value": ">=2000000000000000000 || value <=4000000000000000000" // [!code focus]
```

:::info
Note we advise you to filer any `indexed` fields in the contract details in the `rindexer.yaml` file.
As these can be filtered out on the request level and not filtered out in rindexer itself.
You can read more about it [here](/docs/start-building/yaml-config/contracts#indexed_1-indexed_2-indexed_3).
:::

If you have a tuple and you want to get that value you just use the object notation.

For example lets say we want to only get the events for `profileId` from the `quoteParams` tuple which equals `1`:

```json
{
     "anonymous": false,
     "inputs": [
       {
         "components": [
           {
             "internalType": "uint256",
             "name": "profileId", // [!code focus]
             "type": "uint256"
           },
           ...
         ],
         "indexed": false,
         "internalType": "struct Types.QuoteParams",
         "name": "quoteParams", // [!code focus]
         "type": "tuple"
       },
       ...
     ],
