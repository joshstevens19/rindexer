# Streams

:::info
rindexer streams can be used without any other storage providers. It can also be used with storage providers.
:::

rindexer supports streaming data from rindexer to anywhere you want. This allows you to
build your own data indexing solutions in any language you wish, alongside stream the data to any location
you want with tons of use cases. Streams also support advanced filtering and conditions which allows you to filter the data
before it is streamed. This can all be done using no-code and set in the YAML configuration file.

:::info
Rust projects do not get exposed to the stream clients yet but it can easily be exposed in the future.

`webhooks`, `rabbitmq`, `sns` and `redis` together you can do that.
