# Create New Project

rindexer provides two modes for creating new projects, each optimized for different use cases and infrastructure setups.

## Choose Your Mode

### Standard Mode

The default way to create and run rindexer projects. This mode connects to blockchain nodes via RPC endpoints and is suitable for most use cases.

**Best for:**
- Getting started quickly
- Using hosted RPC providers
- Standard indexing requirements
- Development and testing

### Reth Mode

An advanced mode that integrates directly with Reth nodes using Execution Extensions (ExEx). This provides superior performance and reorg handling(coming soon) by connecting directly to your Reth archive node.

**Best for:**
- High-performance production deployments
- Projects requiring minimal latency
- Advanced reorg handling(coming soon)
- Running your own infrastructure

**Requirements:**
- Running Reth archive node
- Advanced knowledge of Ethereum infrastructure

## Quick Comparison

| Feature | Standard Mode | Reth Mode |
|---------|--------------|-----------|
| Setup Complexity | Simple | Advanced |
| Infrastructure | Any RPC provider | Reth archive node required |
| Performance | Good | Excellent |
| Reorg Handling | Standard | Native ExEx support |
| Latency | Network dependent | Minimal |
| Best For | Most projects | High-performance production |

## Not Sure Which to Choose?

If you're just getting started with rindexer or don't have specific performance requirements, we recommend starting with **Standard Mode**. You can always migrate to Reth Mode later if your project requirements change.

For production deployments with high-performance requirements or if you're already running Reth infrastructure, **Reth Mode** provides the best indexing experience.
