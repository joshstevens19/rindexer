# Historic indexing

If you want to index only historic data between block ranges just put in the [start_block](/docs/start-building/yaml-config/contracts#start_block)
and [end_block](/docs/start-building/yaml-config/contracts#end_block) in the YAML configuration file. This will index
only the data between those blocks.

:::info
rindexer will save the last synced block for each contract in the database so it can pick up where it left off if stopped and started again.
If you want to start fresh you can use the [delete](/docs/start-building/delete) command to drop all the data and start over.
You can also use the [drop_each_run](/docs/start-building/yaml-config/storage#drop_each_run) option in the YAML configuration file to drop all the data for the indexer before starting.

# Live indexing

If you want to index live data you can just remove the [start_block](/docs/start-building/yaml-config/contracts#start_block)
and [end_block](/docs/start-building/yaml-config/contracts#end_block) from the YAML configuration file. This will index
from the latest block and then index all new blocks as they come in.

:::info
Important to know this will NOT track last synced block and when you start and stop the indexer it will start from the latest block.

# Historic and live indexing

If you want to index historic data and then live data you can put in the [start_block](/docs/start-building/yaml-config/contracts#start_block)
you wish to index the data from and then remove the [end_block](/docs/start-building/yaml-config/contracts#end_block) from the YAML configuration file. This will index
from the block you specified and then index all new blocks as they come in.
