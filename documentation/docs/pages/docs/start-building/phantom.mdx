# Phantom events

Phantom events enable you to add custom events or modify existing events for any smart contract.
This feature allows you to extract any data you need from smart contracts without the constraints of on-chain modifications.

## What are Phantom Events?
Phantom events are gasless events logged in an off-chain execution environment that mirrors the mainnet state in real-time.
They provide a solution for obtaining additional information from a contract without incurring extra gas costs for users.

## Why Use Phantom Events?

Whether you don't control the contract or want to avoid additional gas costs, phantom events offer a flexible solution
for diverse data needs and use cases. Powered by [Shadow](https://www.shadow.xyz/) and [dyRPC](https://ui.dyrpc.network/),
they are part of the rindexer suite designed to simplify being able to use these powerful features.

## Getting Started with Phantom Events
rindexer abstracts away the complexity and offers first-party support for implementing phantom events.
It utilizes Etherscan APIs to download source code and ABIs for the contracts you want to index.
Note that the shared Etherscan API key may lead to rate limits if heavily used.
To avoid this, we recommend adding your own API key here [here](/docs/start-building/yaml-config/global#etherscan_api_key).

Right let's get started with phantom events.

## Providers

:::warning
To use phantom events you will need to have a provider, rindexer just offers first-party support for implementing phantom events.
:::

### [Shadow](https://www.shadow.xyz/)

Shadow enables you to modify a deployed contract's source code to add gasless custom event logs and view functions on a shadow fork that
is instrumented to mirror mainnet state in realtime.

#### Networks Supported

- Ethereum

### [dyRPC](https://ui.dyrpc.network/)

dyRPC is a tool built on top of overlay which can be ran on any erigon node and allows you to also modify the contract's source code
adding gasless custom event logs and view functions.

#### Networks Supported

- Ethereum

## Dependencies

### Installing Foundry

:::info
If you do not have `foundry` installed it will install it for you when you run the `init` command but we recommend you install it yourself.
:::

foundry is required to be installed to compile the contracts.

```bash
curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash
```

if you already have got foundry installed you can run `foundryup` to update it.

## Init

rindexer uses its CLI first approach for everything and phantom events behaves the same way. Each rindexer project by default
does not have phantom events enabled you have to set them up for each project.

To enable phantom events for your rindexer project you can run the following command:

```bash
rindexer phantom init
```

### Required information

- Shadow
    - API key (generate on the shadow portal)
    - Fork ID (generate on the shadow portal)
- dyRPC
    - API key (generate on the dyRPC portal or use "new" to generate a new one)

You will be asked to pick your provider and add your API key. It will save the API key
int the `.env` file under `RINDEXER_PHANTOM_API_KEY` in your project directory.
It will also add your phantom provider to the `rindexer.yaml` file.

## Clone

As the `rindexer.yaml` file is defined by you we use these contract names and network names to allow you to
easily understand what you are cloning.

:::info
Only verified contracts on Etherscan can be cloned, if you wish to use an unverified contract it will still work
but you will have to create the foundry project manually in the `phantom` folder.
:::

```bash
rindexer phantom clone --contract-name <CONTRACT_NAME> --network <NETWORK>
```

lets say we had a `rindexer.yaml` file like this:

```yaml
name: RocketPoolETHIndexer
description: My first rindexer project
repository: https://github.com/joshstevens19/rindexer
project_type: no-code
networks:
- name: ethereum
  chain_id: 1
  rpc: https://mainnet.gateway.tenderly.co
storage:
  postgres:
    enabled: true
    drop_each_run: true
contracts:
- name: RocketPoolETH
  details:
  - network: ethereum
    address: "0xae78736cd615f374d3085123a210448e74fc6393"
    start_block: '18600000'
    end_block: '18718056'
  abi: ./abis/RocketTokenRETH.abi.json
  include_events:
  - Transfer
```

to clone this contract you would run the following command

```bash
rindexer phantom clone --contract-name RocketPoolETH --network ethereum
```

This will create you a folder called `phantom` in the root of your rindexer project and also create the network name
to make it easier to find contracts you have cloned. for example in the above example it will create a folder called `phantom/ethereum/`
and inside it will have a folder called `RocketPoolETH/` which will have your solidity project files and the contract ABI.
This folder will contain all the phantom contracts you have cloned.

You can now go to the contracts folder and start making changes to the phantom contracts.

## Add your own event

Above we cloned `RocketPoolETH` on `ethereum` lets open up `RocketTokenRETH.sol` and add a phantom event on transfer hook.

```solidity
contract RocketTokenRETH is RocketBase, ERC20, RocketTokenRETHInterface {
    using SafeMath for uint;

    event EtherDeposited(address indexed from, uint256 amount, uint256 time);
    event TokensMinted(address indexed to, uint256 amount, uint256 ethAmount, uint256 time);
    event TokensBurned(address indexed from, uint256 amount, uint256 ethAmount, uint256 time);
    event PhantomTransferTime(address indexed from, uint256 time); // [!code focus]

    ...

    function _beforeTokenTransfer(address from, address, uint256) internal override {
        // emit your own event
        emit PhantomTransferTime(from, block.timestamp); // [!code focus]

        // Don't run check if this is a mint transaction
        if (from != address(0)) {
            // Check which block the user's last deposit was
            bytes32 key = keccak256(abi.encodePacked("user.deposit.block", from));
            uint256 lastDepositBlock = getUint(key);
            if (lastDepositBlock > 0) {
                // Ensure enough blocks have passed
                uint256 depositDelay = getUint(keccak256(abi.encodePacked(keccak256("dao.protocol.setting.network"), "network.reth.deposit.delay")));
                uint256 blocksPassed = block.number.sub(lastDepositBlock);
                require(blocksPassed > depositDelay, "Not enough time has passed since deposit");
                // Clear the state as it's no longer necessary to check this until another deposit is made
                deleteUint(key);
            }
        }
    }
```

That is it you can now compile and deploy your phantom contract which we will go over in the next section.

## Editing existing events

You can edit any event to whatever you want for example lets say we wanted to change `TokensMinted` to include
the new balance of the `to` address after minted.

```solidity
contract RocketTokenRETH is RocketBase, ERC20, RocketTokenRETHInterface {
    using SafeMath for uint;

    event EtherDeposited(address indexed from, uint256 amount, uint256 time);
    event TokensMinted(uint256 newBalance, address indexed to, uint256 amount, uint256 ethAmount, uint256 time); // [!code focus]
    event TokensBurned(address indexed from, uint256 amount, uint256 ethAmount, uint256 time);
    event PhantomTransferTime(address indexed from, uint256 time);

    ...

    function mint(uint256 _ethAmount, address _to) override external onlyLatestContract("rocketDepositPool", msg.sender) {
        // Get rETH amount
        uint256 rethAmount = getRethValue(_ethAmount);
        // Check rETH amount
        require(rethAmount > 0, "Invalid token mint amount");
        // Update balance & supply
        _mint(_to, rethAmount);
        // Emit tokens minted event
        emit TokensMinted(balanceOf(_to), _to, rethAmount, _ethAmount, block.timestamp); // [!code focus]
    }
```

That is it you can now compile and deploy your phantom contract which we will go over in the next section.

:::info
If editing different events on different networks (aka your indexing `RocketPoolETH` on ethereum as well as base)
your contract details should be separate for each network in the `rindexer.yaml` file,
as when you deploy the phantom contract it will remap the new ABI and if your events now do not match the types
it will error.
:::

## Compile

:::info
rindexer uses `foundry` to clone and compile the contracts.
:::

To compile the phantom contracts you can run the following command:

```bash
rindexer phantom compile --contract-name <CONTRACT_NAME> --network <NETWORK>
```

So using the same yaml example as above you would run the following command:

```bash
rindexer phantom compile --contract-name RocketPoolETH --network ethereum
```

This will show you the same compile errors as `foundry` would show you if you have made any mistakes.

## Deploy

Deploying your phantom contract is different to deploying a normal contract. rindexer will take care of uploading
the new phantom contract to the provider and all the mappings for you in the `rindexer.yaml` file.

```bash
rindexer phantom deploy --contract-name <CONTRACT_NAME> --network <NETWORK>
```

So using the same yaml example as above you would run the following command:

```bash
rindexer phantom deploy --contract-name RocketPoolETH --network ethereum
```

This will do a few things to your yaml file:

1. It will add the phantom network to the `rindexer.yaml` file this is always named `phantom_${NETWORK_NAME}_${CONTRACT_NAME}`

```yaml
name: RocketPoolETHIndexer
description: My first rindexer project
repository: https://github.com/joshstevens19/rindexer
project_type: no-code
networks:
- name: ethereum
  chain_id: 1
  rpc: https://mainnet.gateway.tenderly.co
- name: phantom_ethereum_RocketPoolETH // [!code focus]
  chain_id: 1 // [!code focus]
  rpc: PROVIDER_RPC // [!code focus]
...
```

2. It will change the `contracts` section to point the contract details to the phantom network.

```yaml
name: RocketPoolETHIndexer
description: My first rindexer project
repository: https://github.com/joshstevens19/rindexer
project_type: no-code
networks:
- name: ethereum
  chain_id: 1
  rpc: https://mainnet.gateway.tenderly.co
- name: phantom_ethereum_RocketPoolETH // [!code focus]
  chain_id: 1 // [!code focus]
  rpc: PROVIDER_RPC // [!code focus]
storage:
  postgres:
    enabled: true
    drop_each_run: true
contracts:
- name: RocketPoolETH
  details:
  - network: phantom_ethereum_RocketPoolETH // [!code focus]
    address: "0xae78736cd615f374d3085123a210448e74fc6393"
    start_block: '18600000'
    end_block: '18718056'
  abi: ./abis/phantom_ethereum_RocketPoolETH.abi.json
  include_events:
  - Transfer
...
```

3. It will upload the new ABI to your `abi` folder named the same as the network name but with the `.abi.json` extension.

```yaml
name: RocketPoolETHIndexer
description: My first rindexer project
repository: https://github.com/joshstevens19/rindexer
project_type: no-code
networks:
- name: ethereum
  chain_id: 1
  rpc: https://mainnet.gateway.tenderly.co
- name: phantom_ethereum_RocketPoolETH // [!code focus]
  chain_id: 1 // [!code focus]
  rpc: PROVIDER_RPC // [!code focus]
storage:
  postgres:
    enabled: true
    drop_each_run: true
contracts:
- name: RocketPoolETH
  details:
  - network: phantom_ethereum_RocketPoolETH // [!code focus]
    address: "0xae78736cd615f374d3085123a210448e74fc6393"
    start_block: '18600000'
    end_block: '18718056'
  abi: ./abis/phantom_ethereum_RocketPoolETH.abi.json // [!code focus]
  include_events:
  - Transfer
...
```

right now lets include the `PhantomTransferTime` event in our yaml file `include_events` array so we can index it.

```yaml
name: RocketPoolETHIndexer
description: My first rindexer project
repository: https://github.com/joshstevens19/rindexer
project_type: no-code
networks:
- name: ethereum
  chain_id: 1
  rpc: https://mainnet.gateway.tenderly.co
- name: phantom_ethereum_RocketPoolETH
  chain_id: 1
  rpc: PROVIDER_RPC
storage:
  postgres:
    enabled: true
    drop_each_run: true
contracts:
- name: RocketPoolETH
  details:
  - network: phantom_ethereum_RocketPoolETH
    address: "0xae78736cd615f374d3085123a210448e74fc6393"
    start_block: '18600000'
    end_block: '18718056'
  abi: ./abis/phantom_ethereum_RocketPoolETH.abi.json
  include_events:
  - PhantomTransferTime // [!code focus]
...
```

## Indexing

everything else is same as before so you can run `rindexer start all` the database tables will all be created,
indexer will start indexing and the GraphQL API will be available at http://localhost:3001/graphql.

:::info
Expect slower indexing as you will have to wait for the phantom provider to index the events.
All phantom providers at the moment use block ranges over optimal ranges so phantom events will be slower
than normal events.
:::

That is it you now have created phantom events with rindexer.
