# Add

These commands allow you to through the CLI add elements to your YAML file.

## Contract

:::warning
You must have networks setup in the YAML to be able to use this command. You can see how to do that [here](/docs/start-building/yaml-config/networks).
:::

This allows you download the contracts metadata alongside the ABI from an supported network using Etherscan APIs.
This uses a shared Etherscan API key to try to download the ABIs, this means you will get rate limited if you use this too much
or if many people use this at the same time. You can add your own API key [here](/docs/start-building/yaml-config/global#etherscan_api_key).

You can see all the chains you can download ABIs from [here](https://docs.etherscan.io/contract-verification/supported-chains).

```bash
rindexer add contract
```

it then ask you 2 questions:

1. "Enter Network Name" - This is the network name in your YAML file.

```yaml
networks:
  - name: ethereum // [!code focus]
    chain_id: 1
    rpc: https://mainnet.gateway.tenderly.co
```

This will skip for you if you only have one network setup.

2. "Enter Contract Address" - This is the contract address you want to add to your YAML project

It will then download the ABI and put it in the `abis` folder and map it automatically in your YAML file.

Some things to know:
- If the contract is not verified on Etherscan it will not be able to download the ABI.
- If the contract is a proxy it try to download the ABI of the implementation contract.
