# Create New Project

:::info
Make sure you have the CLI installed before starting a new project.
You can find the installation instructions [here](/docs/introduction/installation).
:::

We advise anyone using rindexer to install docker which makes running locally with postgres storage a lot easier.
If you not got docker you can install it [here](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).

## 1. Create a new project

This will walk you through setting up your project by asking you a series of questions in the terminal.

:::code-group

```bash [no-code]
rindexer new no-code
```

```bash [rust]
rindexer new rust
```

:::

### Example New

```bash
Initializing new rindexer project...

Project Name: RocketPoolETHIndexer
Project Description (skip by pressing Enter): My first rindexer project
Repository (skip by pressing Enter): https://github.com/joshstevens19/rindexer
What Storages To Enable? (graphql can only be supported if postgres is enabled) [postgres, csv, both, none]: postgres
Postgres Docker Support Out The Box? [yes, no]: yes

rindexer no-code project created with a rETH transfer events YAML template.
```

If any of the steps are unclear, you can find more information in the [New Project Appendix](#new-project-appendix).

Once completed a new boilerplate project will be created in the current directory. You can navigate to the project directory and start building your project.
The boilerplate project is configured to index rETH transfer and approval events from ethereum mainnet between a specific block range.

## 2. Add Environment Variables

If you are not using `postgres` you can move straight to [starting your project](/docs/start-building/create-new-project#3-start-the-project).

If you selected `yes` to the `Postgres Docker Support Out The Box?` question, a `.env` file has be generated for you
with the required environment variables. You can move straight to [starting your project](/docs/start-building/create-new-project#3-start-the-project).

--------------------------------

Open up the generated `.env` file and fill in the required environment variables.

### DATABASE_URL

:::warning
Can skip if:
- on question "What Storages To Enable?" you selected csv or none
- on question "Postgres Docker Support Out The Box?" you selected yes
:::

For ease of running locally we suggest you enable docker support on the rindexer project, if you did not 
enable docker support with postgres storage you will need to provide a postgres database information in the `.env` file 
which has been generated for you.

`sslmode=require` is supported as well just include it in the connection string.

### POSTGRES_PASSWORD

:::warning
Can skip if:
- on question "What Storages To Enable?" you selected csv or none
- on question "Postgres Docker Support Out The Box?" you selected no
:::

This is injected into the `.env` for your if you selected `yes` to the `Postgres Docker Support Out The Box?` question.
This is used for the docker to create a postgres database for you locally. You do not need this if you have your own postgres database or
on deployed environments. It is purely for local development.

```bash
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password
```

### Other Environment Variables

Every part of the `rindexer.yaml` file can be overridden by an environment variable.
The syntax for this in the `rindexer.yaml` is `${ENV_VARIABLE_NAME}` example `${POLYGON_RPC_URL}`. This can be used in ANY field in the YAML file.
Read more about the environment variables in the [yaml configuration documentation](/docs/start-building/yaml-config#environment-variables).

## 3. Config your `rindexer.yaml` file

Generating a rindexer project will generate a `rindexer.yaml` file for you. This is where you will configure your project.
You can read all about the rindexer.yaml settings in the [yaml configuration documentation](/docs/start-building/yaml-config).
You can also use the [rindexer add](/docs/start-building/add) command to add contracts to your project and pull in ABIs for you.

It will generate you an boilerplate project which is configured to index rETH transfer and approval events from ethereum mainnet between a specific block range.

```yaml
name: rETHIndexer
description: My first rindexer project
repository: https://github.com/joshstevens19/rindexer
project_type: no-code
networks:
  - name: ethereum
    chain_id: 1
    rpc: https://mainnet.gateway.tenderly.co
storage:
  postgres:
    enabled: true
contracts:
  - name: RocketPoolETH
    details:
    - network: ethereum
      address: "0xae78736cd615f374d3085123a210448e74fc6393"
      start_block: 18600000
      end_block: 18718056
    abi: ./abis/RocketTokenRETH.abi.json
    include_events:
    - Transfer
    - Approval
```

## 4. Start the project

:::info
rindexer starts your postgres docker compose file up for you automatically if the DATABASE_URL can not connect to the database and docker-compose.yml is present in the parent directory.
You will need to make sure you have docker running on your machine before starting the project. If you have not got docker you can install it [here](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).
You can also run docker manually by using `docker compose up -d`.
:::

:::info
graphql can only run if you have postgres storage enabled
:::

:::code-group

```bash [graphql and indexer]
rindexer start all
```

```bash [indexer only]
rindexer start indexer
```

```bash [graphql only]
rindexer start graphql
```

:::

:::warning
The boilerplate template uses a free node which may get rate limited. We recommend using a paid node for production.
:::

## 5. Query the GraphQL API

:::info
It is worth noting that the graphql API is here for convenience as it works out the box with the postgres storage,
if your building an advance indexer you may want to build your own API on top of the data you have indexed.
If that's the case it is fine just to use rindexer as the indexing tool and build your own API on top of it.
:::

:::info
Each page request will have a max query limit of 1000 per page to avoid memory and database issues.
:::

GraphQL will be available at http://localhost:3001/graphql and the playground at http://localhost:3001/playground.
You can read more about rindexer GraphQL API in the [API documentation](/docs/accessing-data/graphql).

:::code-group

```graphql [request]
query AllTransfers($orderBy: [TransfersOrderBy!] = [BLOCK_NUMBER_DESC], $first: Int = 5) {
  allTransfers(orderBy: $orderBy, first: $first) {
    nodes {
      blockHash
      blockNumber
      contractAddress
      from
      network
      nodeId
      to
      txHash
      value
    }
    pageInfo {
      endCursor
      hasNextPage
      hasPreviousPage
      startCursor
    }
  }
}
```

### Generate graphql queries

You can generate .graphql prebuilt queries to get up and running in seconds.
These will be generated in a `queries` folder.

```bash
rindexer codegen graphql
```

#### TypeScript

[graphql-codegen](https://the-guild.dev/graphql/codegen) is the best tool on the market to generate TypeScript typings for your GraphQL queries, mutations, and subscriptions.

learn about the `codegen.ts` config [here](https://the-guild.dev/graphql/codegen/docs/config-reference/codegen-config)

the graphql API url is the `schema` in the config, you can set this to your graphql endpoint like so:

```ts
import { CodegenConfig } from '@graphql-codegen/cli'

const config: CodegenConfig = {
  // this is YOUR_GRAPHQL_API_URL // [!code focus]
  schema: 'http://localhost:3001/graphql', // [!code focus]
  ...
}

export default config
```

then how you hook up the config with your tool of choice, below are some links to documentation:

- React Apollo - https://the-guild.dev/graphql/codegen/plugins/typescript/typescript-react-apollo#with-react-hooks
- React Query - https://the-guild.dev/graphql/codegen/plugins/typescript/typescript-react-query
- Node app - https://the-guild.dev/graphql/codegen/plugins/typescript/typescript-urql

#### .NET, Dart, Java, Flow

codegen for other languages can be found [here](https://the-guild.dev/graphql/codegen)

## New Project Appendix

If you are not sure what to select this section will explain each step in more detail.

### What Storages To Enable?

- Postgres - This will use a postgres database to store the data.
- Csv - This will store the data in a csv file on the machine.
- Both - This will store the data in both a postgres database and a csv file.
- None - This will not store the data anywhere.

### Postgres Docker

- Yes - This will use docker to spin up a postgres database for you, great for local development.
- No - This will not use docker and you will need to provide a postgres database information in the `.env` file.
