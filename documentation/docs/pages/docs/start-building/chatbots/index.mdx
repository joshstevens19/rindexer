:::info

rindexer has first-class support for Chatbots, this means you can use your favourite chat platform to
send messages to when events happen on chain.

:::info
Due to rate limits out of rindexer control ChatBots will only send messages with max block range of 10 blocks.
Most people who will use rindexer Chatbots will only want to start sending messages of the live data anyway.
The ChatBots are really only meant to be ran sending live data not historic data.
