# Telegram

Telegram is one of the most popular chat platforms, and is great to build bots and notifications when things happen on chain.

:::info
Due to rate limits out of rindexer control ChatBots will only send messages with max block range of 10 blocks.
Most people who will use rindexer Chatbots will only want to start sending messages of the live data anyway.
The ChatBots are really only meant to be ran sending live data not historic data.
:::

## Setup a bot on telegram

You have to use telegram itself to setup a bot:

1. Search BotFather on Telegram.
2. Type /start to get started.
3. Type /newbot to get a bot.
4. Enter your Bot name and unique Username, which should end with the bot.
5. Then, you will get your Bot token. (keep this safe you need it shortly)

## Configure rindexer

`telegram` property accepts an array allowing you to split up the chats any way you wish.

                              " // [!code focus]
```

## bot_token

This is your telegram bot token which you generate using @BotFather.

:::info
We advise you to put this in a environment variables.
:::

```yaml
...
contracts:
- name: RocketPoolETH
  details:
  - network: ethereum
    address: "0xae78736cd615f374d3085123a210448e74fc6393"
    start_block: "18600000"
    end_block: "18600181"
  abi: "./abis/RocketTokenRETH.abi.json"
  include_events:
  - Transfer
  chat: // [!code focus]
    telegram: // [!code focus]
      - bot_token: ${TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN} // [!code focus]
```

## chat_id

You have add your bot to chats to use it, so this is the chat ID you wish the bot to send messages to.

```yaml
...
contracts:
- name: RocketPoolETH
  details:
  - network: ethereum
    address: "0xae78736cd615f374d3085123a210448e74fc6393"

    end_block: "18600181"
  abi: "./abis/RocketTokenRETH.abi.json"
  include_events:
  - Transfer
  chat: // [!code focus]
    telegram: // [!code focus]
      - bot_token: ${TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN}
        chat_id: -4223616270 // [!code focus]
```

## networks

This is an array of networks you want to send messages to this telegram chat.

```yaml [rindexer.yaml]
...
contracts:
- name: RocketPoolETH
  details:
  - network: ethereum
    address: "0xae78736cd615f374d3085123a210448e74fc6393"
    start_block: "18600000"
    end_block: "18600181"
  abi: "./abis/RocketTokenRETH.abi.json"
  include_events:
  - Transfer
  chat: // [!code focus]
    telegram: // [!code focus]
      - bot_token: ${TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN}
        chat_id: -4223616270
        networks: // [!code focus]
          - ethereum // [!code focus]
```

## messages

This is an array of messages you want to send to this telegram chat. It is an array as you can define many different
messages to send to this chat with different conditions.

### event_name

This is the name of the event you want to send a message for, must match the ABI event name.

```yaml [rindexer.yaml]
...
contracts:
- name: RocketPoolETH
  details:
  - network: ethereum
    address: "0xae78736cd615f374d3085123a210448e74fc6393"
    start_block: "18600000"
    end_block: "18600181"
  abi: "./abis/RocketTokenRETH.abi.json"
  include_events:
  - Transfer
  chat: // [!code focus]
    telegram: // [!code focus]
      - bot_token: ${TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN}
        chat_id: -4223616270
        networks:
          - ethereum
        messages:
          - event_name: Transfer // [!code focus]
```

### conditions

This accepts an array of conditions you want to apply to the event data before sending a message to this telegram chat.

:::info
This is optional, if you do not provide any conditions all the events will be sent to this telegram chat.
:::

You may want to filter on the message based on the event data, if the event data has not got an index on the on the
solidity event you can not filter it over the logs. The `conditions` filter is here to help you with this,
based on your ABI you can filter on the event data.

rindexer has enabled a special syntax which allows you to define on your ABI fields what you want to filter on.

1. `>` - higher then (for numbers only)
2. `<` - lower then (for numbers only)
3. `=` - equals
4. `>=` - higher then or equals (for numbers only)
5. `<=` - lower then or equals (for numbers only)
6. `||` - or
7. `&&` - and

So lets look at an example lets say i only want to get transfer events which are higher then `2000000000000000000` RETH wei

```yaml [rindexer.yaml]
...
contracts:
- name: RocketPoolETH
  details:
  - network: ethereum
    address: "0xae78736cd615f374d3085123a210448e74fc6393"
    start_block: "18600000"
    end_block: "18600181"
  abi: "./abis/RocketTokenRETH.abi.json"
  include_events:
  - Transfer
  chat: // [!code focus]
    telegram: // [!code focus]
      - bot_token: ${TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN}
        chat_id: -4223616270
        networks:
          - ethereum
        messages:
          - event_name: Transfer // [!code focus]
            conditions: // [!code focus]
              - "value": ">=2000000000000000000" // [!code focus]
```

We use the ABI input name `value` to filter on the value field, you can find these names in the ABI file.

```json
{
    "anonymous":false,
    "inputs":[
      {
        "indexed":true,
        "internalType":"address",
        "name":"from",
        "type":"address"
      },
      {
        "indexed":true,
        "internalType":"address",
        "name":"to",
        "type":"address"
      },
      {
        "indexed":false,
        "internalType":"uint256",
        "name":"value", // [!code focus]
        "type":"uint256"
      }
    ],
    "name":"Transfer",
    "type":"event"
}
```

You can use the `||` or `&&` to combine conditions.

```yaml [rindexer.yaml]
...
contracts:
- name: RocketPoolETH
  details:
  - network: ethereum
    address: "0xae78736cd615f374d3085123a210448e74fc6393"
    start_block: "18600000"
    end_block: "18600181"
  abi: "./abis/RocketTokenRETH.abi.json"
  include_events:
  - Transfer
  chat: // [!code focus]
    telegram: // [!code focus]
      - bot_token: ${TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN}
        chat_id: -4223616270
        networks:
          - ethereum
        messages:
          - event_name: Transfer
            conditions: // [!code focus]
              - "value": ">=2000000000000000000 && value <=4000000000000000000" // [!code focus]
```

You can use the `=` to filter on other aspects like the `from` or `to` address.

```yaml [rindexer.yaml]
...
contracts:
- name: RocketPoolETH
  details:
  - network: ethereum
    address: "0xae78736cd615f374d3085123a210448e74fc6393"
    start_block: "18600000"
    end_block: "18600181"
  abi: "./abis/RocketTokenRETH.abi.json"
  include_events:
  - Transfer
  chat: // [!code focus]
    telegram: // [!code focus]
      - bot_token: ${TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN}
        chat_id: -4223616270
        networks:
          - ethereum
        messages:
          - event_name: Transfer
              conditions: // [!code focus]
                - "from": "0x0338ce5020c447f7e668dc2ef778025ce3982662 || 0x0338ce5020c447f7e668dc2ef778025ce398266u" // [!code focus]
                - "value": ">=2000000000000000000 || value <=4000000000000000000" // [!code focus]
```

:::info
Note we advise you to filer any `indexed` fields in the contract details in the `rindexer.yaml` file.
As these can be filtered out on the request level and not filtered out in rindexer itself.
You can read more about it [here](/docs/start-building/yaml-config/contracts#indexed_1-indexed_2-indexed_3).
:::

If you have a tuple and you want to get that value you just use the object notation.

For example lets say we want to only get the events for `profileId` from the `quoteParams` tuple which equals `1`:

```json
{
     "anonymous": false,
     "inputs": [
       {
         "components": [
           {
             "internalType": "uint256",
             "name": "profileId", // [!code focus]
             "type": "uint256"
           },
           ...
         ],
         "indexed": false,
         "internalType": "struct Types.QuoteParams",
         "name": "quoteParams", // [!code focus]
         "type": "tuple"
       },
       ...
     ],
     "name": "QuoteCreated", // [!code focus]
     "type": "event"
}
```

```yaml [rindexer.yaml]
...
contracts:
- name: RocketPoolETH
  details:
  - network: ethereum
    address: "0xae78736cd615f374d3085123a210448e74fc6393"
    start_block: "18600000"
    end_block: "18600181"
  abi: "./abis/RocketTokenRETH.abi.json"
  include_events:
  - Transfer
  chat: // [!code focus]
    telegram: // [!code focus]
      - bot_token: ${TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN}
        chat_id: -4223616270
        networks:
          - ethereum
        messages:
          - event_name: Transfer
            conditions: // [!code focus]
              - "quoteParams.profileId": "=1" // [!code focus]
```

### template_inline

You can then write your own template inline, this is the template you want to send to the chat.
You have to use the ABI input names in object notation for example if i wanted to put value in the template
i just have to write `{{value}}` in the template and it will be replaced with the value of the event itself.

The template supports:
- bold text = \*bold text\*
- italic text = \_italic text\_
- inline url = \[inline URL\](YOUR_URL)
- inline fixed-width code = \`inline fixed-width code\`
- pre-formatted fixed-width code block = \`\`\`pre-formatted fixed-width code block\`\`\`
- pre-formatted fixed-width known code block = \`\`\`rust pre-formatted fixed-width known code block\`\`\`
- breaks = just line break in the template

#### transaction_information

You also can use the `transaction_information` object to get common information about the transaction, this is the
transaction information for the event.

```rs
#[derive(Debug, Serialize, Deserialize, Clone)]
pub struct TxInformation {
    pub network: String,
    // This will convert to a hex string in the template
    pub address: Address,
    // This will convert to a hex string in the template
    pub block_hash: H256,
    // This will convert to a string decimal in the template
    pub block_number: U64,
    // This will convert to a hex string in the template
    pub transaction_hash: H256,
    // This will convert to a string decimal in the template
    pub log_index: U256,
    // This will convert to a string decimal in the template
    pub transaction_index: U64,
}
```

:::info
To avoid confusion `address` in `transaction_information` is the address of the contract the event was emitted from.
:::

#### format_value

You can use the `format_value` function to format the value of the event to a decimal value with the specified decimals.

Lets put it all together:
