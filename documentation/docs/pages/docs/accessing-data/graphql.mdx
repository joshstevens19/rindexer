# GraphQL

GraphQL is a query language for your API, and a server-side runtime for executing queries using a type system you define for your data.

you can learn all about graphql [here](https://graphql.org)

## Hot Tip

As GraphQL is a type system this means building queries can be a bit tricky, if you are not familiar with GraphQL.
The beauty of this is using the http://localhost:3001/playground supplied for you allows you to build up all your queries
but also understand every single filter and ordering you can do.

## Querying the data

The GraphQL will expose a playground for you which you can get to on http://localhost:3001/playground
this uses apollo server sandbox which is a great tool for testing and building up your queries - https://studio.apollographql.com/sandbox/explorer.

Note in these examples we will put the raw parameters in the graphql query but you can pass parameters in using the `$` syntax allowing
code to define the parameters.

:::code-group

```graphql [hardcoded parameter]
query AllTransfers {
  allTransfers(first: 20) {
    nodes {
      blockHash
      blockNumber
      contractAddress
      from
      network
      nodeId
      to
      txHash
      value
    }
    pageInfo {
      endCursor
      hasNextPage
      hasPreviousPage
      startCursor
    }
  }
}
```

```graphql [parameter passed in]
query AllTransfers($first: Int!) {
  allTransfers(first: $$first) {
    nodes {
      blockHash
      blockNumber
      contractAddress
      from
      network
      nodeId
      to
      txHash
      value
    }
    pageInfo {
      endCursor
      hasNextPage
      hasPreviousPage
      startCursor
    }
  }
}
```

### Query naming conventions

lets say we had 2 events `Approval` and `Transfer` from the ERC20 standard, the ABI would look like the below:

```json
{
    "anonymous": false,
    "inputs": [
      {
        "indexed": true,
        "name": "owner",
        "type": "address"
      },
      {
        "indexed": true,
        "name": "spender",
        "type": "address"
      },
      {
        "indexed": false,
        "name": "value",
        "type": "uint256"
      }
    ],
    "name": "Approval",
    "type": "event"
  },
  {
    "anonymous": false,
    "inputs": [
      {
        "indexed": true,
        "name": "from",
        "type": "address"
      },
      {
        "indexed": true,
        "name": "to",
        "type": "address"
      },
      {
        "indexed": false,
        "name": "value",
        "type": "uint256"
      }
    ],
    "name": "Transfer",
    "type": "event"
  }
```

with rindexer graphql you could generate the following queries to get the transfer data you need:

:::code-group

```graphql [list of transfers]
query AllTransfers {
  allTransfers {
    nodes {
      blockHash
      blockNumber
      contractAddress
      from
      network
      nodeId
      to
      txHash
      value
    }
    pageInfo {
      endCursor
      hasNextPage
      hasPreviousPage
      startCursor
    }
  }
}
```

```graphql [single transfer]
query Transfer($nodeId: ID!) {
  transfer(nodeId: $nodeId) {
    nodeId
    rindexerId
    contractAddress
    from
    to
    value
    txHash
    blockNumber
    blockHash
    network
  }
}
```

:::

The format of the query names are:
- list items = `all{event_name}s` = `All` + `Transfer` + `s` = `AllTransfers`
- single item = `{event_name}` (lowercase) = `transfer`

For single item queries you can use the `nodeId` to query single items which is always returned as a field
in the list results alongside the singular item query.

#### Conflicting event naming

:::warning
Important to read if you have 2 events with matching names across contracts.
:::

If you have 2 events which have exactly the same name as another contract this is a conflict of naming for graphql so rindexer will render
it as `{contract_name}{event_name}` in pascal case, for example `Transfer` would turn into `{contract_name}Transfer`

So its is super clear lets say i had a yaml like this:

```yaml
name: RocketPoolETHIndexer
description: My first rindexer project
repository: https://github.com/joshstevens19/rindexer
project_type: no-code
networks:
- name: ethereum
  chain_id: 1
  kind: Rpc
  rpc: https://mainnet.gateway.tenderly.co
storage:
  postgres:
    enabled: true
contracts:
- name: RocketPoolETH
  details:
  - network: ethereum
    address: 0xae78736cd615f374d3085123a210448e74fc6393
    start_block: '18600000'
    end_block: '18718056'
  abi: ./abis/RocketTokenRETH.abi.json
  include_events:
  - Transfer
- name: RocketPoolETHFork
  details:
  - network: ethereum
    address: 0xba78736cb615f374d3035123a210448e74fc6392
    start_block: '18600000'
    end_block: '18718056'
  abi: ./abis/RocketTokenRETH.abi.json
  include_events:
  - Transfer
```

My query names for `allTransfers` would be:

- `AllRocketPoolETHTransfers`
- `AllRocketPoolETHForkTransfers`

### Ordering

:::info
All filtering options and ordering can both be used together.
:::

You can order the results by any field you wish, you can also order by multiple fields the first item in the array will
be the applied ordering first then the next will be applied after and so on.

:::warning
It is advised to have indexes on any fields you which to filter on in your database to make the queries faster.
You can define your own indexes in the [storage](/docs/start-building/yaml-config/storage#indexes) section of the YAML configuration file.
:::

This example will get the first 20 transfers ordered by the block number ascending.

```graphql
query AllTransfers {
  allTransfers(first: 20, orderBy: [BLOCK_NUMBER_ASC]) {
    nodes {
      blockHash
      blockNumber
      contractAddress
      from
      network
      nodeId
      to
      txHash
      value
    }
    pageInfo {
      endCursor
      hasNextPage
      hasPreviousPage
      startCursor
    }
  }
}
```

### Filtering

:::info
All filtering options and ordering can both be used together.
:::

You can do condition filters as well as advanced filters on all the events indexed.

:::warning
It is advised to have indexes on any fields you which to filter on in your database to make the queries faster.
You can define your own indexes in the [storage](/docs/start-building/yaml-config/storage#indexes) section of the YAML configuration file.
:::

#### Condition

You can filter in every event property you want using the `condition` input fields.

The example below im filtering on all transfer based on the block number, which has to be a string as its a BigFloat.

```graphql
query AllTransfers {
  allTransfers(first: 20, condition: {
    blockNumber: "18600181"
  }) {
    nodes {
      blockHash
      blockNumber
      contractAddress
      from
      network
      nodeId
      to
      txHash
      value
    }
    pageInfo {
      endCursor
      hasNextPage
      hasPreviousPage
      startCursor
    }
  }
}
```

You can mix the filtering in every direction with any field so you can filter `blockNumber` with `from` and `to` with `value`
or even `network` with `contractAddress` and `txHash`, anything you wish.

```graphql
query AllTransfers {
  allTransfers(first: 20, condition: {
    blockNumber: "18600181",
    value: "2000000000000000000"
    from: "0x0338ce5020c447f7e668dc2ef778025ce398266b"
  }) {
    nodes {
      blockHash
      blockNumber
      contractAddress
      from
      network
      nodeId
      to
      txHash
      value
    }
    pageInfo {
      endCursor
      hasNextPage
      hasPreviousPage
      startCursor
    }
  }
}
```

#### Filter

:::info
Advanced filtering is enabled by default but these filters easily be abused and cause performance issues, if you wish to disable
it you can set `disable_advanced_filters` to true in the [graphql](/docs/start-building/yaml-config/graphql#disable_advanced_filters) section of the YAML configuration file.
:::

For more advanced filtering you can use the `filter` input field. For example if we wanted to get all transfer events
over 1 rEth (wei would be 1000000000000000000) and after block number 18600181 we can use the following query.

```graphql
query AllTransfers {
  allTransfers(first: 20, condition: {
    value: "1000000000000000000",
  }, filter: {
    blockNumber: {
      greaterThan: "18600181"
    }
  }) {
    nodes {
      blockHash
      blockNumber
      contractAddress
      from
      network
      nodeId
      to
      txHash
      value
    }
    pageInfo {
      endCursor
      hasNextPage
      hasPreviousPage
      startCursor
    }
  }
}
```

### Result limits

You can define how many you which to return using the `first` and `last` properties, you can not return more
then 1000 in a single query but you can use offset to get the item you wish to get. We advise to always
set a limit on the amount of items you wish to return.

- first will return the first inserted x items
- last will return the last inserted x items
- offset will return the first/last x items after the offset

:::code-group

```graphql [first]
query AllTransfers {
  allTransfers(first: 20) {
    nodes {
      blockHash
      blockNumber
      contractAddress
      from
      network
      nodeId
      to
      txHash
      value
    }
    pageInfo {
      endCursor
      hasNextPage
      hasPreviousPage
      startCursor
    }
  }
}
```

```graphql [last]
query AllTransfers {
  allTransfers(last: 20) {
    nodes {
      blockHash
      blockNumber
      contractAddress
      from
      network
      nodeId
      to
      txHash
      value
    }
    pageInfo {
      endCursor
      hasNextPage
      hasPreviousPage
      startCursor
    }
  }
}
```

```graphql [offset]
query AllTransfers {
  allTransfers(first: 20, offset: 20) {
    nodes {
      blockHash
      blockNumber
      contractAddress
      from
      network
      nodeId
      to
      txHash
      value
    }
    pageInfo {
      endCursor
      hasNextPage
      hasPreviousPage
      startCursor
    }
  }
}
```

:::

### Page info

The page info will give you the following information:

- endCursor: The cursor to continue from
- hasNextPage: If there is a next page
- hasPreviousPage: If there is a previous page
- startCursor: The cursor to start from

#### Cursor based pagination

Cursor-based pagination is a common approach to pagination that avoids some of the pitfalls of "classic" page-based pagination.
The idea is to encode the current state of the query into a "cursor" that can be passed back to the server to get the next page of results.

You can page through the data using `before` and `after` cursors, you can get the cursors from the `pageInfo` object.

- `before` will get the items before the cursor - this is how you go back in the data so say page 2 to page 1
- `after` will get the items after the cursor - this is how you go forward in the data so say page 1 to page 2

:::code-group

```graphql [next results]
query AllTransfers {
  allTransfers(
      first: 1,
      orderBy: [BLOCK_NUMBER_ASC],
      after: "WyJibG9ja19udW1iZXJfYXNjIixbMTg2MDAxODEsMV1d"
    ) {
    nodes {
      blockHash
      blockNumber
      contractAddress
      from
      network
      nodeId
      to
      txHash
      value
    }
    pageInfo {
      endCursor
      hasNextPage
      hasPreviousPage
      startCursor
    }
  }
}
```

```graphql [preview results]
query AllTransfers {
  allTransfers(
      first: 1,
      orderBy: [BLOCK_NUMBER_ASC],
      before: "WyJibG9ja19udW1iZXJfYXNjIixbMTg2MDAxODEsMV1d"
    ) {
    nodes {
      blockHash
      blockNumber
      contractAddress
      from
      network
      nodeId
      to
      txHash
      value
    }
    pageInfo {
      endCursor
      hasNextPage
      hasPreviousPage
      startCursor
    }
  }
}
```

### Relationships

When you define [relationships](/docs/start-building/yaml-config/storage#relationships) between events rindexer will
automatically create relationships between the events in the database and expose them on the `GraphQL` interface, this
means you can query the relationships within a single query avoiding having to have multiple queries to get the data you need.

Lets walk through an example imagine we were playing around with the `lens` data and we want to get the profile metadata back
when we get quotes created. we can create a relationship between the `QuoteCreated` `quoteParams.profileId` and the `ProfileMetadataSet`
`profileId` events, note you should read about [relationships config](/docs/start-building/yaml-config/storage#relationships) first.

Your `rindexer.yaml` would look like:

```yaml
name: LensIndexer
description: My first rindexer project
repository: https://github.com/joshstevens19/rindexer
project_type: no-code
networks:
  - name: polygon
    chain_id: 137
    rpc: https://polygon.gateway.tenderly.co
storage:
  postgres:
    enabled: true
    relationships: // [!code focus]
      - contract_name: LensHub // [!code focus]
        event_name: QuoteCreated // [!code focus]
        event_input_name: "quoteParams.profileId" // [!code focus]
        linked_to: // [!code focus]
          - contract_name: LensHub // [!code focus]
            event_name: ProfileMetadataSet // [!code focus]
            event_input_name: profileId // [!code focus]
contracts:
  - name: LensHub // [!code focus]
    details:
      - network: polygon
        address: 0xDb46d1Dc155634FbC732f92E853b10B288AD5a1d
        start_block: 59034400
        end_block: 59034400
    abi: ./abis/lens-hub-events-abi.json
    include_events: // [!code focus]
      - QuoteCreated // [!code focus]
      - ProfileMetadataSet // [!code focus]
```

So in this example the `allQuoteCreateds` and `quoteCreated` queries will allow you to get the `ProfileMetadataSet` event
in the same query. This is a basic example but you can see how you can query the relationships within the same query.

```
query AllQuoteCreateds {
  allQuoteCreateds {
    nodes {
      nodeId
      quoteParamsContentUri
      quoteParamsPointedProfileId
      quoteParamsPointedPubId
      by: profileMetadataSetByQuoteParamsProfileId {
        profileId
        metadata
        transactionExecutor
        timestamp
        txHash
        blockNumber
        blockHash
        network
      }
      timestamp
      txHash
    }
  }
}
```

:::info
GraphQL supports aliases to make your queries read even nicer, you can read more about them [here](https://graphql.org/learn/queries/#aliases).
People may not like the event input names and can easily alias them to something more readable.
