          # The underlying event name is `NativeTransfer`. This events section can be omitted, but if you want
          # to alias the stream event name, you can do so by referencing the event `NativeTransfer`.

          # This can be useful in cases where you don't want to make a distinction between, say an Erc20 "Transfer" and
          # a native token transfer, they can be mapped to the same event name.

          # Otherwise, this whole `events` section can be omitted.
