# 🦀 rindexer 🦀

Note rindexer is brand new and actively under development, things will change and bugs will exist - if you find any bugs or have any
feature requests please open an issue on [github](https://github.com/joshstevens19/rindexer/issues).

rindexer is an opensource powerful, high-speed indexing toolset developed in Rust, designed for compatibility with any EVM chain.
This tool allows you to index chain events using a simple YAML file, requiring no additional coding.
For more advanced needs, the rindexer provides foundations and advanced capabilities to build whatever you want.
It's highly extendable, enabling you to construct indexing pipelines with ease and focus exclusively on the logic.
rindexer out the box also gives you a GraphQL API to query the data you have indexed instantly.
